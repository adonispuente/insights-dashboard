# DynaKube for log ingestion.
# DynaKube is the monitoring configuration object.
# The Dynatrace Operator detects this object
# and reconciles monitoring agents accordingly.
# Note, that a cluster can have multiple DynaKube
# objects, i.e., multiple ActiveGates and OneAgent
# Daemonsets each with different configurations.
# This file is aligned with https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/dynatrace-config
