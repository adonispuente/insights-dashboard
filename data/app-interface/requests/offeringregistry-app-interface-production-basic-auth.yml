description: |
  users from Offering Registry can add a CPaaS pipeline to describe that the offering is using a CPaaS pipeline 
  (i.e https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/product-security/offering-registry-reports/-/blob/main/ansible-automation-platform/offering.yaml). 
  We want to add the possibility that users add an app-interface folder and we will retrieve information from the app-interface repo.
