    Hello,

    We have added a new validation that validates users' public GPG keys.
    Your public GPG key was found to be invalid and was removed from app-interface in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/merge_requests/4213.

    To re-add your public GPG key, please follow the instructions in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface#adding-your-public-gpg-key.

    Thank you!
