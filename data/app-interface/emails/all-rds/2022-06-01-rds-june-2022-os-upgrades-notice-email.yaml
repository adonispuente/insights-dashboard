  Hello,

  This a follow-up email to the ongoing RDS maintenance. There is no need 
  to keep reading if you don't use RDS. This maintenance includes two phases:
  minor version upgrades and OS upgrades. Thanks to your collaboration, 
  phase one is largely complete, by now your instance should be running a 
  compliant engine minor version. This email is related to the second phase, 
  which includes the OS upgrades.
  
  For all the RDS instances managed by App Interface, we will be scheduling 
  the RDS OS upgrades in Staging for the next maintenance window occurring 
  after Monday, June 6 14:00 UTC. Please expect downtime for this upgrade 
  (minimal for those that are configured to use Multi-AZ). 

  We will be scheduling OS upgrades for Production environment during your 
  next maintenance window after June 30 14:00 UTC, a separate email will be 
  sent out as notification.

  If you have any other questions, please see our "RDS OS Upgrades - June 2022" 
  page [1] or reach out to AppSRE [2].
