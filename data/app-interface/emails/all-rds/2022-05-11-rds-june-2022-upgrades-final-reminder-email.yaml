  Hello,

  This is a follow-up email to the one sent back in February regarding
  mandatory RDS upgrades for the majority of RDS instances managed in
  app-interface. You can stop reading this email now if your team doesn't use
  AWS RDS.

  The deadline for applying database engine minor version upgrades is
  June 1, 2022 [1]. This date is quickly approaching, so please be sure to upgrade
  your database if you haven't already. As per the
  "RDS OS Upgrades - June 2022" document [1], starting after the deadline, the
  AppSRE team will begin scheduling RDS OS upgrades for staging instances
  during the RDS maintenance window that your team has configured. After
  June 30th, the RDS OS upgrades will automatically be applied to your
  production RDS instances during the configured maintenance windows
  (this is enforced by AWS). See the previously mentioned document for more
  information about how much downtime to expect.

  Please reach out to AppSRE [2] with any questions or concerns.
