  Hello,

  If you have RDS instances managed by App interface, we are pleased to let
  you know that now you can subscribe to RDS event notifications via Email 
  on App Interface. This can be achieved by following this documentation [1].
   
  By subscribing to these notifications, you will be informed when there 
  are database engine upgrades, and other kinds of maintenance related events.
  Furthermore you can choose to be notified when your instance has a failover, 
  backup or availability issue. For more information on RDS event notifications, 
  check out this AWS documentation [2]. 
  
  If you have any other questions, please reach out to AppSRE [3].
