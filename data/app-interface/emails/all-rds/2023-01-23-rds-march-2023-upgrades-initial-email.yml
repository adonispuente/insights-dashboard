  Hello,

  This email is related to RDS instance upgrades that are required by the
  majority of instances managed in app-interface. If your team doesn't use AWS
  RDS, then you can skip this email now.

  Starting February 20, 2023 00:00:01 AM UTC, AWS will not permit the creation
  of new RDS instances with PostgreSQL minor versions lower than the supported
  ones [1].

  The deadline for the database engine minor version upgrades will be April 20,
  2023. RDS will upgrade your PostgreSQL databases minor versions as well as any
  instances restored from the snapshots of these versions to the latest minor
  version during a scheduled maintenance window between March 20, 2023 00:00:01
  UTC and April 20, 2023 00:00:01 UTC. On April 20, 2023 00:00:01 AM UTC, any
  PostgreSQL databases running deprecated minor versions that remain will be
  upgraded to the latest minor version regardless of instances scheduled
  maintenance window.

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
