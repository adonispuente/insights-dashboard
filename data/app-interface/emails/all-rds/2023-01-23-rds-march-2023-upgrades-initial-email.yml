  Hello,

  This email is related to RDS instance upgrades that are required by the
  majority of instances managed in app-interface. If your team doesn't use AWS
  RDS, then you can skip this email now.

  AWS is ending standard support for for PostgreSQL minor versions 14.2, 14.1,
  13.6, 13.5, 13.4, 13.3, 12.10, 12.9, 12.8, 12.7, 11.15, 11.14, 11.13, 11.12,
  10.20, 10.19, 10.18 and 10.17. This means that RDS instances running the
  listed engine versions will require an upgrade.

  The deadline for the database engine minor version upgrades will be March 20,
  2023. We ask that tenants running the listed versions above upgrade to one of
  the approved versions [1].

  Your next step should be to see our page "RDS Upgrades - March 2023" [2] to
  determine if your RDS instances are affected, and begin planning for the
  upgrades if they are.

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
