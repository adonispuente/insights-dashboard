  Hello,

  This a follow-up email to the ongoing RDS maintenance. There is no need 
  to keep reading if you don't use RDS.
  
  For those who have RDS instances managed by App interface, we will be scheduling 
  the OS upgrades for all the Production instances during your next RDS maintenance 
  window occurring after Thursday, June 30 14:00 UTC, unless you have reached 
  out to us for an exception. Please expect downtime for this upgrade 
  (minimal for those that are configured to use Multi-AZ).

  If you have any other questions, please see our "RDS OS Upgrades - June 2022" 
  page [1] or reach out to AppSRE [2].
