  Hello,

  This email is related to RDS instance upgrades that are required by the
  majority of instances managed in app-interface. If your team doesn't use AWS
  RDS, then you can stop reading this email now.

  AWS released an operating system (OS) upgrade to improve the security posture
  of RDS instances. This OS upgrade can only be applied to databases that are
  running fairly recent database engine minor versions. This means that RDS
  instances running older engine minor versions may require two separate
  upgrades - one for the database engine minor version and another for the RDS
  instance operating system.

  The deadline for the database engine minor version upgrades will be June 1,
  2022. RDS instances will then begin to automatically apply OS upgrades during
  your configured maintenance window starting June 30th. We are reaching out
  early so that teams have sufficient time to plan for the changes and test the
  upgrades in stage environments. Your next step should be to see our page
  "RDS Upgrades - June 2022" [1] to determine if your RDS instances are
  affected, and begin planning for the upgrades if they are.

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
