    Hello,

    It seems like you opted-out of receiving invitations for the
    https://github.com/rhdt-dev organization, so we are removing the
    corresponding role from the app-interface:

    https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/merge_requests/3791

    This is just a notification, no action is needed. If you think this is a
    mistake, please reach out to the App SRE Team.

    The AppSRE Team.
