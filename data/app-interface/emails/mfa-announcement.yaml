  Hello,

  This is an automated email sent as part of an app-interface merge request[1]

  The App SRE team manages access to AWS accounts for service owners
  who need to access various resources, such as application logs.

  As part of our security improvements, we are going to enforce MFA (Multi Factor Authentication)
  for all access that is managed via app-interface.

  Please follow these instructions[2] to activate MFA.

  In case you need assistance, please consult our FAQ[3] or create a ticket on the ASIC Jira board[4].

  Access to AWS accounts will require setting up an MFA device, effective immediately.

  Thanks you!
