  Hello,

  This is an automated email sent as part of an app-interface merge request[1]

  The App SRE team uses the CloudWatch Log Forwarding Addon to forward
  Application and Infra logs to AWS CloudWatch on the cluster's AWS account.
  This access is currently granted using the "app-sre" AWS account (950916221866).

  As part of our security improvements, we have created a dedicated AWS account
  for only this purpose - "app-sre-logs" (744086762512).

  We have granted access to the app-sre-logs AWS account for all users who
  currently have access through the app-sre AWS account.
  We request that all users switch to using the app-sre-logs AWS account to view
  their application logs in CloudWatch.

  Please follow these instructions[2] to get access to your application logs.

  In case you need assistance, please consult our FAQ[3] or create a ticket on the ASIC Jira board[4].

  Access to the app-sre AWS account will be automatically revoked on Monday, February 7th.

  Thanks you!
