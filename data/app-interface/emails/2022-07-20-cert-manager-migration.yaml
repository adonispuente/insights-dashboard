  Hello,

  The AppSRE team is changing the way of getting Let's Encrypt certificates in Routes
  managed by app-interface. We are moving away from openshift-acme in favour of
  cert-manager operator.

  The required action from your side is to update your Route manifests adding the
  required cert-manager annotations and remove the openshift-acme deployment. You can
  find the detailed instructions in the cert-manager runbook[1]

  Please reach out to #sd-app-sre for questions or issues.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
