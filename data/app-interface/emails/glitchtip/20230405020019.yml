  Hello App-Interface service owner,

  Access to all Glitchtip organizations and projects must be revalidated regularly.
  This ensures that the access is still valid and is needed to safeguard against unauthorized access.
  Please review, within one week, all your App-Interface roles referencing Glitchtip
  organizations (https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/search?search=glitchtip_roles%3A&nav_source=navbar&project_id=13582&group_id=5301&search_code=true&repository_ref=master).

  If you have questions about this, please post a question in the #sd-app-sre Slack channel.

  Thank you,
  The SRE team
