  Hello,

  The AppSRE team are upgrading the managed Unleash instances you are using from Unleash v3 to v4 (4.8.2).

  This work was tracked in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSRE-3449.

  This introduces many new features, but should be backwards compatible.

  The non-production instances are being upgraded in parallel to this email being sent (April 24, 2022).
  Production instances will be upgraded next Sunday, May 1st, 2022.

  Please take the week to validate the stage instances are working as expected.
  Please reach out to #sd-app-sre for questions or issues.

  Thanks!

  The AppSRE team
