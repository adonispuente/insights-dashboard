  Hello,

  As part of SDE-2428 (Move identity provider for AppSRE clusters from Github to RedHat SSO), we have changed the
  authentication methods for our clusters appsres03ue1 (https:///console-openshift-console.apps.appsres03ue1.5nvu.p1.openshiftapps.com)
  and appsrep05ue1 (https://console-openshift-console.apps.appsrep05ue1.zqxk.p1.openshiftapps.com).

  We've enabled the authentication via Red Hat SSO (auth.redhat.com), which is the same method used by the other Red Hat services (e.g.,
  Gitlab-cee, Jira, or Red Hat internal VPN).

  On the staging cluster appsres03ue1, Red Hat SSO is the only available authentication method, while on the production cluster appsrep05ue1,
  the GitHub authentication method will still be available until February 13th.

  After you log in, you should have the same roles and permissions as before; otherwise, please reach out to #sd-app-sre for questions or issues.

  Thanks,
  The AppSRE team
