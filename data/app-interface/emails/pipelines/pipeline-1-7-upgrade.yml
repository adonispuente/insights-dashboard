  Hello,

  This email is related to Continuous Delivery features in app-interface as configured with SaaS files. If you don't use
  SaaS files to for continuous delivery of your service, you can stop reading now.

  SaaS files use OpenShift Pipelines behind the scenes in order to deploy your changes. This operator needs to be
  upgraded periodically to ensure that we're on a supported version [1]. On Wednesday, November 30, 2022 at 19:00 UTC
  we'll be upgrading OpenShift Pipelines from 1.6 to 1.7. The upgrade was already tested on our staging cluster
  including testing SaaS file runs, so we don't expect any impact to our tenants.

  Please reach out to AppSRE [2] with any questions or concerns.
