    Hello,

    This is a message from the Service Delivey App SRE team!

    The App SRE team is running dozens of Red Hat services on top of OSD using a self-service platform called app-interface. You probably already know that.
    The reason we are sending this mail is because we need your help!

    We know that using app-interface may be difficult at times. We are constantly working to improve the overall experience (from knowledge sharing, to MR reviews and automation improvements).
    At the same time, we know that many of you already know a thing or two about it.

    This is a call to start a community of app-interface users helping others. The amount of questions we are getting is immense and we do our best to answer every single one.
    Since we are working in a company that values community and open source, we encourage you to get involved in discussions in the sd-app-sre Slack channel.

    If you happen to know (or even just think you know) the answer to a question raised in the channel, please feel free to get involved!
    This will help us ease the load off the app-sre-ic (Interrupt Catcher), allowing them to focus on handling incidents and clearing the app-interface MR queue.

    We have already been seeing sparse cases of users getting involved and we appreciate it!

    Let us know what you think by replying (offline) to this email to sd-app-sre@redhat.com.


    While we have you here, this is also an opportunity to ask you to ping the app-sre-ic only in cases that require immediate attention.
    Got a general question? Does not require a ping - Simply put a message in the sd-app-sre Slack channel, and someone will respond.
    MR opened 2 minutes ago? Does not require a ping.
    MR that needs to go in and has been waiting in the queue for a while? May require a ping.

    A word about app-interface merge requests -
    1. We try to review every MR within 3 hours.
    2. A MR approved by an App SRE team member will be labeled with a `lgtm` label.
    3. The general merging strategy is FIFO.
    4. There are additional labels that will get prioritized over `lgtm` MRs (anything starting with `bot/`).


    Thank you for taking the time to read this! (assuming you have made it this far)

    Regards,

    The App SRE Team
