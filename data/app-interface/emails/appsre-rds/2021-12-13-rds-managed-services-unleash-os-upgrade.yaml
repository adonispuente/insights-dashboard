  Hello,

  A mandatory OS upgrade is required for the following RDS instance(s):

  - managed-services-unleash

  The mandatory OS upgrade will be performed on Wednesday, January 5, 2022 from
  14:00 to 15:00 UTC. This upgrade will result in a downtime. If your
  instance(s) are configured for Multi-AZ, the downtime should be limited to
  the time it takes to fail over from the primary to the standby (typically <1
  minute) [1]. Any instances that do not have Multi-AZ enabled can expect a
  downtime of approximately 10 minutes.

  Starting January 10, 2022, any RDS instances that have not been upgraded will
  be during the next available maintenance window [2]. The AppSRE team is
  upgrading instances proactively rather than waiting for the upgrade to be
  applied during the next maintenance window after January 10th.

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
