  Hello,

  Your Postgres RDS instance policies-ui-backend-stage in the insights-stage account is
  running the 11.8 version that can be affected by the PostgreSQL
  CVE-2020-25695 [1] which allows a malicious authenticated user to execute
  arbitrary SQL functions under the identity of a superuser.

  In order to avoid any potential issue, it will be upgraded to the 11.10
  version on 2021-05-11 from 14:00 to 15:00 UTC. You can expect a minimal downtime
  while the database is stopped to change the postgres binary and restarted.

  [1] https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-131-125-1110-1015-9620-and-9524-released-2111/

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
