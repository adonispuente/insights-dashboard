  Hello,

  A mandatory OS upgrade is required for the following RDS instance(s):

  - tower-analytics-stage

  Starting January 10, 2022, any RDS instances that have not been upgraded will
  be during the next available maintenance window [1]. The AppSRE team is
  upgrading instances proactively so that you have time to confirm that the
  changes do not impact your services, before the upgrade is applied to
  production instances.

  The OS upgrade will require a downtime. If your instance(s) are configured
  for Multi-AZ, the downtime should be limited to the time it takes to failover
  from the standby to the primary (typically <1 minute) [2]. Any instances that
  do not have Multi-AZ enabled can expect a downtime of approximately 10
  minutes.

  This upgrade will be performed on Thursday, December 9, 2021 from 14:00 to
  15:00 UTC. The initial batch of upgrades will be for staging databases only.
  A follow-up email will be sent for any affected production databases.

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
