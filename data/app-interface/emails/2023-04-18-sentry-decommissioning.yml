  Hello,

  This is a final reminder that the self-hosted Sentry instance (https://sentry.devshift.net) will be shutdown
  and decommissioned on May 2nd, 2023 9:00 UTC.

  Please migrate your applications to Glitchtip (https://glitchtip.devshift.net) as soon as possible.

  Glitchtip is an error-tracking service like Sentry, and it's compatible with the Sentry SDK. The official end-user documentation
  is available at https://glitchtip.com/documentation, and how to integrate it into your application can be found
  in the app-interface documentation
  (https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master#create-a-glitchtip-organization-dependenciesglitchtip-organization-1yml).

  If you have questions or concerns about this, please post a question in the #sd-app-sre Slack channel.

  Thank you,
  The SRE team
