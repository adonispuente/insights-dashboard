  tl;dr: AppSRE has introduced into app-interface a more expressive permissions
  model, which grants you more power to manage your services in app-interface
  by reducing the need for AppSRE reviews and approval.


  Service Engineering Teams,

  It is with great pleasure that AppSRE announces the availability of app-interface
  granular permissions, which reduces the need for AppSRE review and approval of
  changes to your configurations and deployments.


  How does it work?

  app-interface now supports the declaration of "change-types" [1], which are
  classes of modifications that can be made to resources by users with particular
  roles. Using change-types, you can enable permissions for tasks as expansive as
  "change everything for all namespaces in a cluster" to tasks as fine-grained
  as "bump the version of a single vault secret" or "change the TTL of a
  record in a specific DNS zone."

  Declaring change-types is a matter of defining what is desired, what makes
  sense, and what is safe.

  If a change-type is in effect for your service, your team members can approve
  changes to app-interface configuration on their own, which streamlines
  workflows and reduces bottlenecks.

  You can learn more about change types and granular permissions here [1] and
  the available change-types here [2].


  Where do we go from here?

  AppSRE will continue to define new self-service permissions with the goal
  of supporting the Hybrid SRE model and increasing the amount of
  self-serviceable changes in general.

  Do you have an idea for a new change-type? Let us know and create a ticket
  on the AppSRE Jira Board [3].
