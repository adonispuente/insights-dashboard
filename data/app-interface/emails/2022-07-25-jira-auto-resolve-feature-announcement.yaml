  Hello,

  The AppSRE team is excited to announce release of a new feature to resolve jira tickets automatically created by
  AppSRE automation. 

  The required action from your side is to update your Route manifests adding the
  required cert-manager annotations and remove the openshift-acme deployment. You can
  find the detailed instructions in the cert-manager runbook[1]

  Please reach out to #sd-app-sre for questions or issues.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
