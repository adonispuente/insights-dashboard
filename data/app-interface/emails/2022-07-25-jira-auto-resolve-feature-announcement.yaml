  SUBJECT - '[Feature announcement] Automatically resolve jira tickets created through AppSRE automation'


  Hello,

  The AppSRE team is excited to announce the release of a new feature to resolve jira tickets automatically. This feature will help reduce manual toil of resolving tickets such DVO tickets, incorrect metadata tickets etc when underlying cause has been addressed.

  We have enabled this feature for the majority[1] of jira boards having issue resolution state listed as `Done`/`Closed`/`Resolved`. The only action we require from you is to verify the resolution state assigned. You can refer to service-dev guidelines[2] for any future updates.
  
  We were unable to enroll a small number of jira boards due to technical issues, so we encourage tenants to reach out to us in the meantime. We will also reach out proactively to these tenants over the next few days to address this. 


  In addition, We encourage our tenants to fill out this short survey[3] so that we can deliver a better experience.

  Please reach out to #sd-app-sre for questions or issues.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
