  Hello,
  
  As announced last week, The App SRE team will now begin performing several minor version upgrades for vault.ci.ext.devshift.net.

  There is no anticipated impact to performance during this change.
  
  We will send another communication at the completion of the upgrades.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
