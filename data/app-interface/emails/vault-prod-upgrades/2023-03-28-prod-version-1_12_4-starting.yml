  Hello,
  
  As previously announced, the App SRE team is now beginning a minor version upgrade process for vault.devshift.net.

  This email is purely for awareness purposes.
  
  There is no anticipated impact to vault or any other services during this upgrade. No actions or special considerations from tenants are needed.
  
  We will send another communication when the upgrade process is complete.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
