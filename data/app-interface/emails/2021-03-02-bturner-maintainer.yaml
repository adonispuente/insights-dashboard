    Hey Ben!

    You have been added as a Maintainer in app-interface!

    What does being an app-interface Maintainer mean for you?

    In this role, you will review CloudDot related MRs and approve them by adding the `lgtm` label.
    To review means to make sure the build passes and that the output report shows the changes which you expect (the report can be found in the results link in a passing build).
    I assume that by now you have looked at the output report more than a few times, so this should be clear.
    Let us know if you need more information on this!

    After adding the `lgtm` label, the MR will be automatically rebased and merged (you will not have powers to rebase yourself).
    Once the MR was merged, you can look at different locations to verify things happened as you expect:
    - #sd-app-sre-reconcile - output of our integrations
    - #sd-app-sre-alert - if integrations are crashing as a result of the merge, there will be an alert there
    - https://ci.int.devshift.net/view/app-interface - integrations that are running against internal resources such as jenkins

    As long as the build passes in a MR - you should be fine. If something happens - I'm sure you'll get pinged by someone from the App SRE team.

    If you have any doubts - it's better not to merge and talk to @app-sre-ic.
    Remember, with great power comes great responsibility! This repository literally holds EVERYTHING WE RUN.

    I'd also like to add that we trust you! Adding you as a Maintainer was a team decision.

    Enjoy your new powers!
