  Hello,

  This email is regarding a Sentry production scheduled maintenance. If your service doesn't use

  Next week AppSRE team will be upgrading the RDS min version of Sentry production. During 16:00 and
  16:30 UTC Sentry will be in maintenance window. The upgrade will be applied during this window.
  It is expected an outage of at least 5 minutes in the period of the upgrade.

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

  Thank you,
