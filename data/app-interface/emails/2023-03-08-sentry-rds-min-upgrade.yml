  Hello,

  This email is regarding a Sentry production scheduled maintenance. If your service doesn't use
  Sentry you can stop reading now.

  Wednesday next week (03/15/2023) AppSRE team will do a database maintenance. During 16:00 and
  16:30 UTC Sentry will be in maintenance window. The upgrade will be applied during this window.
  The maintenance will result in at least 5 minutes of downtime.

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.
