  Hello,

  In an effort to reduce AWS costs, we will be enforcing a log retention period of 90 days across all log groups that currently have a retention period of 'Never expire'. This change will take place on Wednesday September 20, 2023. 

  Please note that if you already have a retention period set in place, this change will not affect those log groups.

  If you need to have the retention period set to a different value, our integration is set up to apply other specified retention periods, documented in our README[1].

  If you have questions or concerns about this, please post a question in the #sd-app-sre Slack channel.

  Thank you,
  The SRE team
