  Hello,

  As part of SDE-1773 we will be migrating https://vault.devshift.net to the Red Hat VPN on December 12th. The migration will start at 8am UTC.

  The migration has no impact on production systems exposed to customers, but there will be a short downtime on promotions during the swap. We expect this to be minimum.

  After this migration, all connections to Vault will need to be done from the VPN.

  In case there is any problem during the initial migration, we will try to migrate it again on December 14th 8am UTC.

  Please reach out to #sd-app-sre for questions or issues.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
