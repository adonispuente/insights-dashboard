  Hello,

  To improve security and performance, we will be moving our bastion into ci.int.devshift.net 
  next Monday December 12th. This will only impact those who uses bastion as a jump host to access 
  hive clusters.

  If you own ci.int Jenkins jobs that are using bastion, you can remove that part of the code  
  as ci.int now have peering in place to allow connection to private clusters. Please contact us if 
  your jobs are running on ci.ext, or better yet migrate them to ci.int.

  If you are using bastion as jump host locally [1], the process will remain the same for the most part   
  and the migration will make it easier because you will be able to do everything within VPN. We will 
  update the SOP as soon as the migration is complete.

  Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

  Thanks,
  The AppSRE team
