  Hello,

  As announced, we will start the migration of vault.devshift.net inside the VPN
  The migration has no impact on production systems exposed to customers, but there will be a short downtime on promotions during the swap. We expect this to be minimum.

  We will send another communication when the migration is finished.

  Sincerely,

  The AppSRE Team.
