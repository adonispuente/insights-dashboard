  Hello,

  This is to let you know that we have now migrated our bastion to ci.int, which means that 
  you can access it within VPN and within VPN only through new DNS record: bastion.ci.int.devshift.net
  
  Meanwhile bastion.ci.ext.devshift.net has been deprecated and should not be used.
  Documentation [1] has been updated. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or concerns.

  Thanks,
  The AppSRE team
