  Hello,

  As already announced, AppSRE will decommission the self-hosted Sentry instance (https://sentry.devshift.net) on April 30th, 2023.
  As part of SDE-2524 (Transition AppSRE tenants to Glitchtip), we are happy to announce that Glitchtip (https://glitchtip.devshift.net)
  is now available for all App-Interface users.

  Glitchtip is an error-tracking service like Sentry, and it's compatible with the Sentry SDK. The official end-user documentation is available at
  https://glitchtip.com/documentation, and how to integrate it into your application can be found in the app-interface documentation
  (https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master#create-a-glitchtip-organization-dependenciesglitchtip-organization-1yml).

  If you have questions or concerns about this, please post a question in the #sd-app-sre Slack channel.

  Thank you,
  The AppSRE team
