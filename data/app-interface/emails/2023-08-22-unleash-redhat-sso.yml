  Hello,

  As part of our work to move away from GitHub authentication in favor of RedHat SSO, we will change the authentication provider
  for all tenant unleash instances (Insights and OCM).

  Besides the authentication and authorization change, this will also remove your GitHub users from the AppSRE GitHub organization.

  As communicated in Slack (https://redhat-internal.slack.com/archives/CCRND57FW/p1692599884779199), the non-prod instances have already been
  updated and the prod instances (https://insights.unleash.devshift.net and https://ocm.unleash.devshift.net) will follow on August 24th, 2023 9:00 UTC.

  If you have questions or concerns about this, please post a question in the #sd-app-sre Slack channel.

  Thank you,
  The SRE team
