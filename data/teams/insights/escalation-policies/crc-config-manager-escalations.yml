  In the event that an app-sre engineer cannot resolve the console.redhat.com
  config-manager issue, they can escalate to the crc-essntl-data-team group.
  Tickets should be opened with the 'config-manager' component.

  If there is no response from @crc-essntl-data-team, escalate to the
  console.redhat.com Platform oncall via PagerDuty.
