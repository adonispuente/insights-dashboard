  This support is work day support (i.e. issues will be tackled in work hours).

  App-SRE is expected to triage an incident and try to resolve the issue using the SOP's, again this is expected to be within work hours.

  The escalations are summarized as follows:

    For non production incidents, reach out to the @devtools team in the #core stream in https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com
    For help on production incidents, reach out to the @devtools team in the #core stream in https://quarkusio.zulipchat.com
