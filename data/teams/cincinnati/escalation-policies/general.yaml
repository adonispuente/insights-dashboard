description: |
  App-SRE is expected to triage an incident and try to resolve the issue.

  In the event that an app-sre engineer is not able to resolve the issue they can escalate
  the issue to @over-the-air-updates or reach out on #forum-updates on CoreOS slack.

  Clusters have a cache of recommended updates, so the impact of a down Cincinnati update
  service is that new clusters will not be able to populate that cache, and clusters which
  update from one version to another will not be able to refresh their cache.

  Impacted customers can mitigate by manually specifying the target release with
  `oc adm upgrade --to-image ...`, as described in `oc adm upgrade --help`.
