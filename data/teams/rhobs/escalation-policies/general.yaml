description: |
  The Observatorium team has developer oncall support for production incidents, however the support
  is not provided 24/7. Currently, due to lack of engineers, the support is provided every 4th week.
  The rest of the time there is no person assigned to be oncall. Please consult the PagerDuty schedule
  to see if anyone is assigned to be oncall for the given week.

  App-SRE is expected to triage an incident and try to resolve the issue using the SOP's.

  The escalations are summarized as follows:

    - For non production incidents, reach out to the @observatorium-oncall on Slack channel #forum-observatorium.
    - For help on production incidents, page the Observatorium oncall on PagerDuty.
    - If no person is assigned to the PagerDuty schedule or the @observatorium-oncall Slack group, please
    reach out to @observatorium-support (additonally also @observatorium-team), which provides the best-effort
    support on RHOBS related issues.
