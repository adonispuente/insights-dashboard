  Deploy third party OLM resources for console.redhat.com.  Each operator will
  get its own resource template in the third-party-operators repo as well as a
  subfolder in app-interface that contains all the namespaces/environments the
  operator is deployed to.  Each operator will be deployed by itself in any
  given namespace.
