description: |
  Host Based Inventory (HBI) is the “source of truth” for system, or host, information across the entire platform.
  HBI is the primary target for all incoming data from the various reporters, like insights-client, RHSM, Satellite, etc,
  and as such it exposes Ingress APIs for creating, updating and deleting host information.
  Conversely, HBI is the primary source of host information for all Applications built on the platform,
  and as such it also exposes Egress APIs for retrieving host information.

  There are multiple types of APIs -
  * REST API for synchronous operations
  * Message Queue (MQ) API for asynchronous notifications of data and state changes
  * Ingress API - asynchronous data ingestion interface
