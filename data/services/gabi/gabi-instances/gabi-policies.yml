 I acknowledge there is no sensitive data or there is sensitive data, but agrees to have a specific engineer accessing it

readReplicasWaiverPledge: |
  I request that the read replicas requirement be waived for my service Insights Policies for the accompanying GABI
  instance deployment in the production environment. I hereby accept risks related to using a primary production
  database instance to carry-out troubleshooting activities, which is the intended use case of the GABI service.
