  This namespace is used remotely from uhc-* namespaces via the
  ocm service account of the ocm namespace. The purpose is to have some cluster
  local coordination/lease mechanism for the controllers running in uhc-*,
  similar to how it is done in Hive. This namespace will only host some configmaps
  put there from remote.
