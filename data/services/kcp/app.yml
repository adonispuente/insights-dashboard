  KCP is providing a kube-like API to manage resources within a hierarchy of 'Workspaces'. Other name: CPS.
  KCP is not onboarding fully on app-interface. It is the first to use the Hybrid SRE model, benefiting from
  a subset of app-interface capabilities.
  This is described in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master/docs/kcp/support-agreement.md.
