  VPC is currently not provisioned by app-interface, it is only here to serve as a data source.
  Managed in https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/app-sre/infra/-/blob/master/terraform/app-sre-stage/vpc-app-sre-stage.tf

  This VPC was created initially to support multi-region use cases such as deploying read-replicas in a different region
  for disaster recovery (see APPSRE-3476).
