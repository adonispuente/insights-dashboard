# App-Interface

This repository serves as a central coordination point for hosted services being
run by the Application SRE team. Many or all of the portions of the contract
defined herein will be handled through automation after changes are accepted to
this repository by the appropriate parties.

If you are a team looking to run your service with the App SRE team, please follow the [onboarding-app](/docs/app-sre/onboarding-app.md) guide.

The Application SRE team is responsible of fulfilling the contract defined in
this repository.

## Overview

This repository contains of a collection of files under the `data` folder.
Whatever is present inside that folder constitutes the App-SRE contract.

These files can be `yaml` or `json` files, and they must validate against some
[well-defined json schemas][https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas].

The path of the files do not have any effect on the integrations (automation
components that feed off the contract), but the contents of the files do. They
will all contain:

- `$schema`: which maps to a well defined schema [schema][https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas].
- `labels`: arbitrary labels that can be used to perform queries, etc.
- Additional data specific to the resource in question.

Continuous delivery is managed using the
[SaaS files](docs/app-sre/continuous-delivery-in-app-interface.md).

## Components

Main App-Interface contract components:

- <https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface>: data files
  that implement the contract.
- <https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas>: schema file
  that define the contract. JSON and GraphQL schemas of the data files.
- <https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-server>: The GraphQL component developed
  in this repository will make the datafiles queryable.

Additional components and tools:

- <https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-validator>: Python script that validates
  the datafiles against the json schemas hosted in `qontract-server`.
- <https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-reconcile>: automation component that
  reconciles the state of third-party services like `github`, with the contract
  definition.

The word _qontract_ comes from _queryable-contract_.

## Workflow

The main use case happens when an interested party wants to submit a contract
amendment. Some examples would be:

- Adding a new user and granting access to certain teams / services.
- Submitting a new application to be hosted by the Application SRE team.
- Modifying the SLO of an application.
- etc.

All contract amendments must be formally defined. Formal definitions are
expressed as json schemas. You can find the supported schemas here:
[schemas][https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas].

1. The interested party will:

- Fork the [app-interface](<https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface>
) repository.
- [Share their fork](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/members/share_project_with_groups.html#sharing-a-project-with-a-group-of-users) of the `app-interface` repository with the [devtools-bot](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/devtools-bot) user as `Maintainer`.
- Submit a MR with the desired contract amendment.

2. Automation will validate the amendment and generate a report of the desired
   changes, including changes that would be applied to third-party services like
   `OpenShift`, `Github`, etc, as a consequence of the amendment.

3. The Application-SRE team will review the amendment and will determine whether
   to accept it by merging the MR.

4. From the moment the MR is accepted, the amended contract will enter into
   effect.

## App-Interface Etiquette

- When you create a MR, it's not necessary to immediately ping the @app-sre-ic in #sd-app-sre. The IC will eventually see it and merge it. It's only necessary to ping the IC if the MR is urgent or if a day has passed and the IC has not commented anything.
- If your PR only contains changes to saas-files, you can auto-approve, see here: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/docs/app-sre/continuous-delivery-in-app-interface.md#approval-process
- Even if you have rights to merge the PR, please refrain from doing so. If you need it merged urgently, ping @app-sre-ic in #sd-app-sre.
- If an AppSRE team members adds the `lgtm` label, it will be automerged by a bot.
- The AppSRE team members will also refrain from manually merging PRs and will use labels instead to allow the bot to automatically merge them. In App-Interface the order of the PRs is important, and if we manually merge, it will affect waiting times for other users.

## Local validation of datafile modifications / contract amendment

Before submitting a MR with a datafile modification / contract amendment, the
user has the option to validate the changes locally.

Two things can be checked: (1) JSON schema validation (2) run integrations with
`--dry-run` option.

Both scripts rely on a temporary directory which defaults to `temp/`, but can be
overridden with the env var `TEMP_DIR`. The contents of this directory will
contain the results of the manual pr check.

### JSON schema validation

Instructions to perform JSON schema validation on changes to the datafiles.

**Requirements**:

- docker (or podman)
- git

**Instructions**:

Run the actual validator by executing:

```sh
# make sure you are in the top dir of the `app-interface` git repo
source .env
make bundle validate # output is data.json
```

The output will be JSON document, so you can pipe it with `jq`, example:
`cat data.json | jq .`

### Running integrations locally with `--dry-run`

Instructions in [this document](/docs/app-sre/sop/running-integrations-manually.md).

## Visual App-interface

Visual App-interface is a visual representation of the data in this repository.
Source code can be found here: https://github.com/app-sre/visual-qontract

An internal instance is reachable (behind the VPN) here:
<https://visual-app-interface.apps.appsrep05ue1.zqxk.p1.openshiftapps.com/graphql>.

A public instance is rechable (authentication via GH) here:
<https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net>.

## Querying the App-interface

The contract can be queried programmatically using a
[GraphQL](<https://graphql.org/learn/>) API.

The GraphQL internal endpoint is reachable (behind the VPN) here:
<https://app-interface.apps.appsrep05ue1.zqxk.p1.openshiftapps.com/graphql>.

The GraphQL public endpoint is reachable (with authentication) here:
<https://app-interface.devshift.net/graphql>.

**IMPORTANT**: in order to use the GraphQL UI you need to click on the Settings
wheel icon (top-right corner) and replace `omit` with `include` in
`request.credentials`.

To get credentials to query app-interface, submit a Credentials Request form in a merge request.
The request itself is a file with the following structure:
* `$schema` - must be `/app-interface/credentials-request-1.yml`
* `labels` - labels to be added to the request (currently not used by automation)
* `name` - name of the request object. must be unique
* `description` - what will these credentials that you are requesting be used for
* `user` - a reference to a user file who this request is for. user file must contain a public gpg key. [instructions](#adding-your-public-gpg-key)
* `credentials` - the credentials which you are requesting
  * current options:
    - app-interface-production-dev-access
    - app-interface-production-cicd-access

Complete example:

```yaml
---
$schema: /app-interface/credentials-request-1.yml

labels: {}

name: example-request-20200512

description: |
  request description

user:
  $ref: /teams/path/to/user/file.yml

credentials: app-interface-production-dev-access

```

Please create the request file [here](/data/app-interface/requests).

## Entities and relations

App-interface data is represented by files that correspond to a schema. Files of one schema may reference files of another schema.

To learn more about the different entities and their relations:

- [Products, Environments, Namespaces and Apps](/docs/app-interface/api/entities-and-relations.md#products-environments-namespaces-and-apps)

## Howto

### Add or modify a user (`/access/user-1.yml`)

You will want to do this when you want to add a user or grant / revoke
permissions for that user.

Users are typically stored in the `teams/<name>/users` folder. Note that the
actual file path will not condition the integrations, you can consider the
directory structure as something that is only useful for human consumption.

Write the file in yaml format with `.yml` extension. The contents must validate
against the current [user schema][userschema].

Make sure you define `$schema: /access/user-1.yml` inside the file.

The `roles` property is the most complex property to understand. If you look at
the `/access/user-1.yml` you will see that it's a list of [crossrefs][crossref].
The `$ref` property points to another file, in this case it must be a
[role][role]. The role file is essentially a collection of
[permissions][permission]. Permissions contain a mandatory property called
`service` which indicate what kind of permission they are. The possible values
are:

- `github-org`
- `github-org-team`
- `quay-org-team`

In any case, you typically won't need to modify the roles, just find the role
you want the user to belong to. Roles can be associated with the services:
`service/<name>/roles/<rolename>.yml`, or to teams:
`teams/<name>/roles/<rolename>.yml`. Check out the currently defined roles to
know which one to add.

#### User off-boarding / revalidation loop

The
[ldap-users](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-reconcile/blob/master/reconcile/ldap_users.py)
integration continuously checks the presence of users in the corporate LDAP
(ldap.rdu.redhat.com). If the user does no longer exist in LDAP, this process
will submit a MR removing the affected user's file from App-Interface. This MR
will be automatically merged.

Once the user file is removed from App-Interface all access granted to the user
will be immediately revoked. Since all access granted by AppSRE is granted
through the presence of this file, this effectively removes all access.

This integration currently runs as a CronJob every hour.

### Get notified of events involving a service, or its dependencies

There are three ways a user or group can get notified of service events (e.g. planned maintenance, outages):

* `serviceOwner`:  Point of contact for communications from Service Delivery to service owners.  Where possible, this should be a development team mailing list (rather than an individual developer).  This field is Required.
* `serviceNotifications`:  This is a list of additional email addresses of employees who would like to receive notifications about a service.  This field is Optional.
* Subscribe to the `sd-notifications@redhat.com` [mailing list](https://post-office.corp.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/sd-notifications). This list receives all event communications.

Find out more about App-SRE Incident Procedures [here](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/blob/master/docs/app-sre/AAA.md#incident-procedure).

Example usage for [Hive](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/blob/master/data/services/hive/app.yml):

```
serviceOwners:
- name: Devan Goodwin
  email: dgoodwin@redhat.com

serviceNotifications:
- name: Hive Mailing list
  email:  aos-hive@redhat.com
```

### Define an escalation policy for a service

There are two steps to defining an escalation policy for a given service:

#### Prerequisites: The team's slack channel and Pagerduty schedule are defined in app-interface

In case you don't meet the prerequisites, please follow:
- [Manage Slack User groups via App-Interface](#manage-slack-user-groups-via-app-interface)

#### Step 1: Define escalation policies for the team:

Each team can have multiple escalation policies defined. This is useful in case the team divides the ownership of developed services. For a single escalation policy, create a general.yml under `teams/<teamname>/escalation-policies/`. An example can be seen [here](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/9bcb0b1c07d79ef164c552b2b970bc0247e9c1fa/data/teams/telemeter/escalation-policies/general.yaml)

Here's a template you can copy-paste and edit as needed:

```yaml


---
$schema: /app-sre/escalation-policy-1.yml

labels: {}

name: <teamname>-general-escalations

description: |
  Here, you should note whether the team has developer oncall support and what the reaction times for each of the escalation channels is.

  Also, we expect some information on escalation criteria.

  In case the team does not have an oncall rotation, it is required to add a `nextEscalationPolicy` -
  a reference to the next escalation policy to follow in case of an incident.
  This can be a Manager escalation for example.

channels:
  slackUserGroup:
  - $ref: /teams/<teamname>/permissions/<teamname>-coreos-slack.yml

  email: 
  - <teamname>@redhat.com

  pagerduty:
    $ref: /dependencies/pagerduty/<teamname>-oncall.yml

  nextEscalationPolicy:
    $ref: /teams/<teamname>/escalation-policies/<next>.yml

```

#### Step 2: Link the service to a team's escalation policy

The next step is to link the defined escalation policy to the service. In order to do that, we add a new `escalationPolicy` reference within the `app.yml`. For example, see [this PR](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/13851/diffs?commit_id=9bcb0b1c07d79ef164c552b2b970bc0247e9c1fa)

### Create a Quay Repository for an onboarded App (`/app-sre/app-1.yml`)

Onboarded applications are modelled using the schema `/app-sre/app-1.yml`. This schema allows any application to optionally define a list required Quay repositories.

The structure of this parameter is the following:

```yaml
quayRepos:
- org:
    $ref: <quay org datafile (`/dependencies/quay-org-1.yml`), for example `/dependencies/quay/openshiftio.yml`>
  teams: # optional
  - permissions:
    - $ref: <quay-membership permission datafile (`/access/permission-1.yml`), for example `/dependencies/quay/permissions/quay-membership-app-sre-managed-services.yml`>
    role: read
  items:
  - name: <name of the repo, e.g. 'centos'>
    description: <description>
    public: <true | false>
  - ...
```

In order to add or remove a Quay repo, a MR must be sent to the appropriate App datafile and add the repo to the `items` array.

The `teams` section should be added if you want to have `read` access to your team's repos. This access will be added to the teams specified in the `permissions` section for each repo in the `items` section.

**NOTE**: If the App or the relevant Quay org are not modelled in the App-Interface repository, please seek the assistance from the App-SRE team.


#### Mirroring Quay Repositories

If you are creating a Quay Repository that is not used for publishing you
application on, but instead is used for mirroring an external repository,
you can automate the mirroring by adding `mirror` section to your `quayRepo`
specification:

```yaml
quayRepos:
- org:
    ...
  items:
  - name: my-private-repo
    ...
    mirror:
      $ref: /dependencies/image-mirrors/docker.io/me/my-private-repo.yml
```

The `$ref` file content would then be:

```yaml
---
$schema: /dependencies/container-image-mirror-1.yml

url: docker.io/me/my-private-repo

pullCredentials:
  path: app-sre/creds/mirror-images/docker-io_me_my-private-repo
  field: all

tags:
  - "latest"
```

The supported fields in the container-image-mirror specification are:

* `url` (mandatory): the url for the image we are to mirror from.
* `pullCredentials` (optional): the path for the vault secret containing the
  `user` and the `token` for the repository.
* `tags` (optional): list of tags to limit the mirroring to. Regular
  expressions are supported. When defined, `tagsExclude` is ignored.
* `tagsExclude` (optional): list of tags to exclude from the mirroring. Regular
  expressions are supported.

### Create a Sentry Project for an onboarded App (`/app-sre/app-1.yml`)

The structure of this parameter is the following:

```yaml
sentryProjects:
- team:
    $ref: <sentry team datafile (`/dependencies/sentry-team-1.yml`), for example `/dependencies/sentry/teams/app-sre-stage.yml`>
  projects:
  - name: <name of the project>
    description: <description of the project>
    email_prefix: <email prefix for emails about the project>
    platform: <project language>
    sensitive_fields:
    -  <sensitive field for the project>
       ...
    safe_fields:
    -  <safe field for the project>
       ...
    auto_resolve_age: (optional) <integer hours for auto resolving, default never>
    allowed_domains:
    - <allowed domain for the project>
      ...
  - ...
- ...
```

The name, description, email-prefix, and platform fields are required, whereas the other fields are optional.

In order to add or remove a Sentry project, a MR must be sent to the appropriate App datafile and the project needs to be added to or removed from the projects array.

### Create a Sentry Team (`/dependencies/sentry-team-1.yml`)

Sentry projects are associated to sentry teams, with only the members of the team able to view the issues of the associated projects.

To define a sentry team create a file in /data/dependencies/sentry/teams with a structure like the following:

```yaml
---
$schema: /dependencies/sentry-team-1.yml

labels:
  service: app-sre

name: app-sre
description: App-SRE official sentry-stage team
instance:
  $ref: /dependencies/sentry/sentry-stage.yml
```

The instance is a reference to a sentry instance.  This is the sentry instance where the team will be created.

### Manage Sentry team membership via App-Interface (`/access/role-1.yml`)

Sentry users and team membership can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface.

In order to get access to Sentry, a user has to have:
* A `role` that includes a `sentry_teams` section, with one or more references to sentry team file(s).
    * Example: [dev](/data/teams/ocm/roles/dev.yml) role.

### Manage Openshift resources via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

[services](/data/services) contains all the services that are being run by the App-SRE team. Inside of those directories, there is a `namespaces` folder that lists all the `namespaces` that are linked to that service.

Namespaces declaration enforce [this JSON schema](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas/blob/main/schemas/openshift/namespace-1.yml). Note that it contains a reference to the cluster in which the namespace exists.

A namespace declaration can contain labels. These will be applied as kubernetes labels on the namespace resource. Note that
* labels must conform to [Kubernetes Labels constraints](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#syntax-and-character-set).
* labels set by other means (eg an operator) will not be overriden. If a conflict exists, an error will be thrown. 

Notes:
* If the resource already exists in the namespace, the PR check will fail. Please get in contact with App-SRE team to import resources to be under the control of App-Interface.
* Manual changes to resources will be overridden by App-Interface in each run.
* If a resource has a `qontract.recycle: "true"` annotation, all pods using that resource will be recycled on every update.
  * Supported resources: Secrets, ConfigMaps

OpenShift resources can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface. A list of supported resource types can be found [here](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas/blob/main/schemas/openshift/namespace-1.yml#L46).

Some resources have special characteristics and are described further below. These have a specific `provider` value.
- `Secret`
- `Route`

For other resources, two `provider` options are available:
- `resource`
- `resource-template`

The `resource-template` provider supports using the `Jinja2` template language to extend the capabilities of the integration. In addition to the [standard Jinja2 language](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/), the following additional capabilities are supported:
- Fetch a secret from vault

    ```jinja
    {{ vault('app-sre/creds/smtp', 'username') }}
    ```

- Fetch a secret from vault with a templated path or key:

    ```jinja
    {{ vault('path/to/secret-with-key-per-namespace', '{{ resource.namespace.name }}') }}
    ```

- Base64 encode a block of data

    ```jinja
    {% b64encode %}
    My data
    {% endb64encode %}
    ```

- Reference the resource & namespace metadata from app-interface

  The `resource` variable is passed to Jinja2 and contains all the resource/namespace metadata as returned by the integration at the point of processing the resource

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: {{ resource.name }}
  data:
    foo: bar
  ```

> **Warning**: The Jinja2 delimiters (`{{ }}` and `{% %}`) conflicts with other templating languages such as go's text/template. To remedy that, the `type` `extracurlyjinja2` can be used to add an extra curly brace to the standard Jinja2 delimiters (resulting in `{{{ }}}` and `{{% %}}`

The next section demonstrates how to manage a `ConfigMap` resource via two examples showing both the `resource` and `resource-template` providers:

#### Manage shared OpenShift resources via App-interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

In order to manage resources for multiple namespaces in a single location you can use a Shared Resources file.

Create a shared resources file with an `openshiftResources` section. [Example](/data/services/ocm/shared-resources/stage.yml). The `openshiftResources` section is defined identically in a namespace file and in a shared resources file (see previous section).

To add the shared resources to a namespace, add a `sharedResources` section to a namespace file and reference the shared resources file. [Example](/data/services/ocm/namespaces/uhc-stage.yml).

#### Example: Manage a ConfigMap via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

In order to add ConfigMaps to a namespace, you need to add them to the `openshiftResources` field.

- `provider`: must be `resource`
- `path`: path relative to [resources](/resources). Note that it starts with `/`.

The object itself must be stored under the `resources` path, and by convention it should be named: `resources/<cluster_name>/<namespace>/<configmap_name>.configmap.yml`.

In order to change the values of a ConfigMap, send a PR modifying the ConfigMap in the `resources` directory, and upon merge it will be applied.

#### Example: Manage a templated ConfigMap via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

A templated opensource resource is configured the same way as a standard resource, with the following changes:

- `provider`: must be `resource-template`
- `type`: can be `jinja2` or `extracurlyjinja2` (default is `jinja2`)

An example of the file content could be:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
type: Opaque
data:
  not_so_secret_value: {{{ vault('app-interface/my-cluster/my-namespace/my-not-so-secret-secret', 'the-key') }}}
```


#### Manage Secrets via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`) using Vault

Instructions:

1. Create a secret in Vault with the data (key-value pairs) that should be applied to the cluster.
  * The secret in Vault should be stored in the following path: `app-interface/<cluster>/<namespace>/<secret_name>`
  * The value of each key in the secret in Vault should **NOT** be base64 encoded.
  * If you wish to have the value base64 encoded in Vault, the field key should be of the form `<key_name>_qb64`.
2. Add a reference to the secret in Vault under the `openshiftResources` field ([example](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/cd9c6062819e2da76ed108f1bf4946ca72e593d6/data/services/cincinnati/namespaces/cincinnati-production.yml#L26-29))with the following attributes:

- `provider`: must be `vault-secret`.
- `path`: absolute path to secret in [Vault](https://vault.devshift.net). Note that it should **NOT** start with `/`.
- `version`: version of secret in Vault.
- `name`: (optional) name of the Kubernetes Secret object to be created. Overrides the name of the secret in Vault.
- `labels`: (optional) labels to add to the Secret.
- `annotations`: (optional) annotations to add to the Secret.
- `type`: (optional) type of the Kubernetes Secret to be created. Defaults to `Opaque` if not specified.

3. In order to change one or more values in a Kubernetes Secret, update the secret in Vault first and submit a new MR with the updated `version` field.
  * The current version can be found in Vault on the top-right of the list of values for your secret.

Notes:

* [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) with fields of type `stringData` are not supported.
* When creating a new secret in Vault, be sure to set the `Maximum Number of Versions` field to `0` (unlimited).
* If you want to delete a secret from Vault, please get in contact with the App-SRE team.
* If you wish to use a different secrets engine, please get in contact with the App-SRE team.
* To create a secret in a `production` environment, please get in contact with the App-SRE team.

Example:

This secret in Vault:
```
{
  "key": "value",
  "otherkey_qb64": "dmFsdWUy"
}
```
Would generate this Kubernetes Secret:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
data:
  key: dmFsdWU=
  otherkey: dmFsdWUy
type: Opaque
```

#### Manage Routes via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`) using Vault

Routes can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface.

In order to add Routes to a namespace, you need to add them to the `openshiftResources` field.

- `provider`: must be `route`
- `path`: path relative to [resources](/resources). Note that it starts with `/`.
- `vault_tls_secret_path`: (optional) absolute path to secret in [Vault](https://vault.devshift.net) which contains sensitive data to be added to the `.spec.tls` section.
- `vault_tls_secret_version`: (optional, mandatory if `vault_tls_secret_path` is defined) version of secret in Vault.

Notes:
* The secret in Vault should be stored in the following path: `app-interface/<cluster>/<namespace>/routes/<secret_name>`.
* In case the Route contains no sensitive information, a secret in Vault is not required (hence the fields are optional).
* It is recommended to read through the instructions for [Secrets](#manage-secrets-via-app-interface-openshiftnamespace-1yml-using-vault) before using Routes.

#### Validate JSON in Secrets and ConfigMaps

If a key of a Secret or ConfigMap keys is a JSON, you can add the option `validate_json` to the openshift resource definition in order to make sure it is valid json.

#### Validate AlertManager configuration in Secrets and ConfigMaps

If a key of a Secret or ConfigMap keys is a JSON, you can add the option `validate_alertmanager_config` to the openshift resource definition in order to make sure it is valid alertmanager config. The integration will look into the `alertmanager.yaml` key of the secret to look for it unless `alertmanager_config_key` is specified.

### Manage openshift-acme deployments via App-Interface

This integration allows namespace owners to deploy openshift-acme to their namespaces.

To deploy and manage an openshift-acme instance, a user must add the following to the [saas-openshift-acme](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/app-sre/cicd/ci-int/saas-openshift-acme.yaml) file:

```yaml
  - namespace:
      $ref: /services/path/to/namespace/file.yaml
    ref: master
```

use `ref` master for stage namespaces and a commit hash as exists in other `ref`s for production namespaces.

### Manage OpenShift Groups association via App-Interface (`/openshift/cluster-1.yml`)

[openshift](/data/openshift) contains all the clusters that are managed by the App-SRE team. Inside of those directories, there is a `cluster.yml` file that describes the cluster.

Clusters declaration enforce [this JSON schema](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas/blob/main/schemas/openshift/cluster-1.yml).

OpenShift group association can be self-serviced via App-Interface.

Groups should be defined under the `managedGroups` section in the cluster file. This is a list of group names that are managed. To associate a user to a group, the user has to be associated to a role that has `access` to the OpenShift group.

An example of a role can be found [here](/data/teams/hive/roles/dev.yml).

### Manage OpenShift LimitRanges via App-Interface (`/openshift/limitrange-1.yml`)

This integration allows namespace owners to manage LimitRanges objects on their namespaces

To deploy and manage LimitRanges on a namespace, a user must add the following to a namespace declaration:

```yaml
limitRanges:
  $ref: /dependencies/openshift/limitranges/<some-name>.yml
```

The LimitRange limits can be customized by creating a new file and referencing the new file in the namespace declaration

The `/openshift/limitrange-1.yml` schema maps to the LimitRanges specs.

### Manage OpenShift ResourceQuotas via App-Interface (`/openshift/quota-1.yml`)

This integration allows namespace owners to manage ResourceQuota objects on their namespaces

To deploy and manage ResourceQuotas on a namespace, a user must add the following to a namespace declaration:

```yaml
quota:
  $ref: /path/to/some/quota.yml
```

The ResourceQuota limits can be customized by creating a new file and referencing the new file in the namespace declaration.

The `/openshift/quota-1.yml` schema maps to the ResourceQuotas specs.

### Self-Service OpenShift ServiceAccount tokens via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

This integration allows namespace owners to get ServiceAccount tokens from a different cluster/namespace in to their namespace for consumption.

To add a Secret to a namespace, containing the token of a ServiceAccount from another namespace, a user must add the following to a namespace declaration:

```yaml
openshiftServiceAccountTokens:
- namespace:
    $ref: /services/<service>/namespaces/<namespace>.yml
  serviceAccountName: <serviceAccountName>
```

The integration will get the token belonging to that ServiceAccount and add it into a Secret called:
`<clusterName>-<namespaceName>-<ServiceAccountName>`.
The Secret will have a single key called `token`, containing a token of that ServiceAccount.

### Enable network traffic between Namespaces via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

To enable network traffic between namespace, a user must add the following to a namespace declaration:

```yaml
networkPoliciesAllow:
- $ref: /path/to/source-namespace.yml
```

This will allow traffic from the `source-namespace` to the namespace in which this section is defined.

In this [example](/data/services/cincinnati/namespaces/cincinnati-production.yml#L18-19), traffic is enabled from the `openshift-customer-monitoring` namespace to the `cincinnati-production` namespace.

### Manage Vault configurations via App-Interface

https://vault.devshift.net is entirely managed via App-Interface and its configuration can be found in [config](/data/services/vault.devshift.net/config) folder of ` vault.devshift.net` service

#### Manage vault audit backends (`/vault-config/audit-1.yml`)
Audit devices are the components in Vault that keep a detailed log of all requests and response to Vault

Example:
```yaml
---
$schema: /vault-config/audit-1.yml

labels:
  service: vault.devshift.net

_path: "file/"
type: "file"
description: ""
options:
  _type: "file"
  file_path: "/var/log/vault/vault_audit.log"
  format: "json"
  log_raw: "false"
  hmac_accessor: "true"
  mode: "0600"
  prefix: ""
```
Current audit backends configurations can be found [here](/data/services/vault.devshift.net/config/audit-backends/)

For more information please see [vault audit backends documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/audit/index.html)

#### Manage vault auth backends (`/vault-config/auth-1.yml`)
Auth backends are the components in Vault that perform authentication and are responsible for assigning identity and a set of policies to a user.

Example:
```yaml
---
$schema: /vault-config/auth-1.yml

labels:
  service: vault.devshift.net

_path: "github/"
type: "github"
description: "github auth backend"
settings:
  config:
    _type: "github"
    organization: "app-sre"
    base_url: ""
    max_ttl: "360h"
    ttl: "120h"
policy_mappings:
  - github_team:
      $ref: <github team datafile (`/access/permission-1.yml`), for example: /dependencies/vault/permissions/app-sre.yml>
    policies:
      - $ref: <vault policy datafile (`/vault-config/policy-1.yml`), for example: /services/vault.devshift.net/config/policies/app-sre-policy.yml>
```
**Note**: some auth backends like github support policy mappings. Policy mapping can be applied to auth backed entity, for example in case with github auth currently allowed entity is a `team`.
To apply vault policy on auth entity `policy_mappings` key should be used.

Current auth backends configurations can be found [here](/data/services/vault.devshift.net/config/auth-backends)

For more information please see [vault auth backends documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/index.html)

#### Manage vault policies (`/vault-config/policy-1.yml`)
Policies provide a declarative way to grant or forbid access to certain paths and operations in Vault

Exmaple:
```yaml
---
$schema: /vault-config/policy-1.yml

labels:
  service: vault.devshift.net

name: "<POLICY_NAME>"
rules: |
  path "<SECRETS_ENGINE>/PATH/*" {
    capabilities = ["create","read","update","delete","list"]
  }
```
Current vault policies can be found [here](/data/services/vault.devshift.net/config/policies)

For more information please see [vault policies documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/policies.html)

For an example on adding team access to manage Vault app-interface secrets see [this PR](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/merge_requests/2097).

#### Manage vault roles (`/vault-config/role-1.yml`)
Roles represents a set of Vault policies and login constraints that must be met to receive a token with those policies.
The scope can be as narrow or broad as desired. Role can be created for a particular machine, or even a particular user on that machine,
or a service spread across machines. The credentials required for successful login depend upon the constraints set on the Role associated with the credentials.
Currently we support only AppRole.

AppRole Example:
```yaml
---
$schema: /vault-config/role-1.yml

labels:
  service: vault.devshift.net

name: "<ROLE_NAME>"
type: "approle"
mount: "approle/"
options:
  _type: "approle"
  bind_secret_id: "true"
  local_secret_ids: "false"
  period: "0s"
  secret_id_num_uses: "0"
  secret_id_ttl: "0s"
  token_max_ttl: "30m"
  token_num_uses: "1"
  token_ttl: "30m"
  token_type: "default"
  bound_cidr_list: []
  policies:
    - <VAULT_POLICY>
  secret_id_bound_cidrs: []
  token_bound_cidrs: []
```
Current vault roles can be found [here](/data/services/vault.devshift.net/config/roles)

For more information please see [vault AppRole documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle.html)

#### Manage vault secret-engines (`/vault-config/secret-engine-1.yml`)
Secrets engines are components which store, generate, or encrypt data. Secrets engines are incredibly flexible, so it is easiest to think about them in terms of their function.
Secrets engines are provided some set of data, they take some action on that data, and they return a result.

KV Secrets engine Example:
```yaml
---
$schema: /vault-config/secret-engine-1.yml

labels:
  service: vault.devshift.net

_path: "<SECRETS_ENGINE_MOUNT_PATH>"
type: "kv"
description: "new kv secrets engine"
options:
  _type: "kv"
  version: "2"
```
Current secrets engines can be found [here](/data/services/vault.devshift.net/config/secret-engines)

For more information please see [vault secrets engines documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/index.html)


### Manage DNS Zones via App-Interface (`/aws/dns-zone-1.yml`) using Terraform

DNS Zones can be managed in app-interface. A DNS zone follows [this
JSON schema](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas/blob/main/schemas/dependencies/dns-zone-1.yml).

- `name`: A name for the DNS zone
- `description`: Description for the DNS zone
- `account`: a `$ref` to the account definition to be used in conjunction with the provider
- `unmanaged_record_names`: A list of regexes to exclude record names from being managed (literal strings work too, those will be considered to be a full match on the record name)
- `records`: A list of `record`. The parameters of the `record` match those of Terraform's [aws_route53_record resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route53_record). In addition to the terraform fields, we also support special fields which are distinguishable by their name starting with `_` (underscore). The special fields are described below.


Additional special fields:
- `_target_cluster`: A `$ref` to an OpenShift cluster definition. The value of `elbFQDN` on the cluster definition will be used as a target on the record
- `_healthcheck`: Allows defining a health check resource that will be assigned to the record. The parameters from Terraform's [aws_route53_health_check resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/route53_health_check) are permitted.

**NOTE:** If you need a record under the `api.openshift.com` zone
[please go to this document](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/docs/app-sre/sop/add-route-for-ocm-component.md)

Example DNS zone resource:
```yaml
---
$schema: /dependencies/dns-zone-1.yml

labels: {}

name: example.com
description: This is an example

account:
  # The account under which the DNS zone will be created
  $ref: /aws/app-sre/account.yml

unmanaged_record_names:
# This is useful if we want to ignore letsencrypt TXT records managed externally by certbot
- '^_acme-challenge.*'

records:
# Simple record, flattened yaml (same line)
- { name: my-record, type: A, records: [127.0.0.1, 127.0.0.2, 127.0.0.3] }

# Simple record, indented yaml 
- name: my-record
  type: A
  records:
  - 127.0.0.1
  - 127.0.0.2
  - 127.0.0.3

# Simple CNAME record using special parameter _target_cluster
- { name: my-cluster, type: CNAME, _target_cluster: { $ref: /openshift/my-cluster/cluster.yml } }

# Multiple weighted records (10%/90% weights)
- name: my-weighted-record
  type: CNAME

  type: CNAME
  ttl: 5
  weighted_routing_policy:
    weight: 10
  set_identifier: my-weighted-record-B
  records:
  - subB.example.com

# Records with healthcheck (foo.example.com will be returned if healthy, otherwise bar.example.com will be returned)
- name: my-healthy-record
  type: CNAME
  ttl: 5
  records:
  - foo.example.com
  failover_routing_policy:
    type: PRIMARY

# NS delegation (the records would be different depending on whats assigned to the delegated zone `my-delegation.example.com`)
- name: my-delegation
  type: NS
  records:
  - ns-660.awsdns-18.net
  - ns-508.awsdns-63.com

```

### Manage AWS access via App-Interface (`/aws/group-1.yml`) using Terraform

[teams](/data/teams) contains all the teams that are being services by the App-SRE team. Inside of those directories, there is a `users` folder that lists all the `users` that are linked to that team. Each `user` has a list of assiciated `roles`. A `role` can be used to grant AWS access to a user, by adding the `user` to an AWS `group`.

Groups declaration enforce [this JSON schema](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas/blob/main/schemas/aws/group-1.yml). Note that it contains a reference to the AWS account in which the group exists.

Notes:
* Manual changes to AWS resources will be overridden by App-Interface in each run.
* A group without associated users will not be created.

#### Manage AWS users via App-Interface (`/aws/group-1.yml`) using Terraform

AWS users can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface.

In order to get access to an AWS account, a user has to have:
* A public binary GPG key, which will be used to encrypt the generated password to send by mail.
* A `role` that includes (at least) one of the following:
  * An `aws_groups` section, with a reference to an AWS group file.
    * Example: [sre-aws](/data/teams/app-sre/roles/app-sre.yml) role.
  * A `user_policies` section, with a reference to a policy json document.
    * Example: [f8a-dev-osio-dev.yml](/data/teams/devtools/roles/f8a-dev-osio-dev.yml)
    * Supported terraform-like templates (will be replaced with correct values at run time):
      * `${aws:accountid}`
      * `${aws:username}`

Once a user is created, an email invitation to join the account will be sent with all relevant information.

#### Generating a GPG key

Note: If terminal cannot find `gpg` after install, your executable may be named `gpg2`.

1. Download and install the GPG command line tools for your operating system. We generally recommend installing the latest version for your operating system.
2. Open Terminal.
3. Generate a GPG key pair. Your key must use RSA.
```
$ gpg --full-generate-key
```
4. A series of prompts directs you through the process. Press the Enter key to assign a default value if desired.
      1. The first prompt asks you to select what kind of key you prefer. Select `RSA and RSA (default)`.  An RSA/RSA key allows you not only to sign communications, but also to encrypt files.
      2. Choose the key size: `4096`.
      3. Choose when the key will expire. You may set this to  `0 = key does not expire`.
      4. Before the gpg application asks for signature information, the following prompt appears: `Is this correct (y/N)?`. Review and enter `y`.
      5. Enter your name and email address for your GPG key. Remember this process is about authenticating you as a real individual. For this reason, include your real name.
      6. At the confirmation prompt, enter the letter O to continue if all entries are correct, or use the other options to fix any problems.
      7. Finally, enter a passphrase for your secret key. The gpg program asks you to enter your passphrase twice to ensure you made no typing errors.
5. Use the `gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG` command to list GPG keys for which you have both a public and private key.

#### Adding your public GPG key

Note: If terminal cannot find `gpg` after install, your executable may be named `gpg2`.

A base64 encoded binary GPG key should be added to the user file, under the `public_gpg_key` parameter.

To export your key:
```
gpg --export <redhat_username>@redhat.com | base64
```

To get your base64 encoded binary GPG key from an [ascii armored output](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x56.html):
```
cat <redhat_username>.gpg.asc | gpg --dearmor | base64
```

To test if your binary base64 encoded GPG key in MR is good You may put part of MR containing key to some file (f.e. FILENAME) and use command:
```
cat FILENAME | sed -e 's/\ //g'| base64 -d | gpg
```

Example: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/blob/f40e0f27eacf5510a954c034292e937632caecc7/data/teams/app-sre/users/jmelisba.yml#L27


### Manage AWS resources via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`) using Terraform

[services](/data/services) contains all the services that are being run by the App-SRE team. Inside of those directories, there is a `namespaces` folder that lists all the `namespaces` that are linked to that service.

Namespaces declaration enforce [this JSON schema](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas/blob/main/schemas/openshift/namespace-1.yml). Note that it contains a reference to the cluster in which the namespace exists.

Notes:
* Manual changes to AWS resources will be overridden by App-Interface in each run.
* To be able to use this feature, the `managedTerraformResources` field must exist and equal to `true`.

#### Manage shared AWS resources via App-interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`) using Terraform

In the time of this writing, Terraform resources can not be added to a [shared resources file](#manage-shared-openshift-resources-via-app-interface-openshiftnamespace-1yml).

The work to enable that is tracked in https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSRE-2614.

To achieve a similar result, we can define a Terraform resource in a single namespace and add only the output Secret to other namespaces.

Instructions:

1. Submit a MR adding the resource to the `terraformResources` section in one of the namespace files. Once the MR is merged, the output secret will be placed in the namespace AND in Vault.
  * The Vault secret has a predefined path: `app-sre/integrations-output/terraform-resources/<cluster_name>/<namespace_name>/<output_resource_name>`
1. Submit another MR [adding the Vault secret](#manage-secrets-via-app-interface-openshiftnamespace-1yml-using-vault) to the `openshiftResources` section in all other namespace files:
  ```yaml
  - provider: vault-secret
    path: app-sre/integrations-output/terraform-resources/<cluster_name>/<namespace_name>/<output_resource_name>
    version: 1
    annotations:
      qontract.ignore_reconcile_time: "true"
  ```

Bonus points:

Add the Vault secret to an `openshiftResources` section in a [shared resources file](#manage-shared-openshift-resources-via-app-interface-openshiftnamespace-1yml) and reference it from the `sharedResources` section of all other namespace files.

#### Manage AWS Certificate via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

[AWS Certificate Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) AWS Certificate Manager is a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates.

In order to import certificates stored in Vault into AWS Certificate Manager, you need to add them to the `terraformResources` field.

- `provider`: must be `acm`
- `account`: The AWS account you want to import certificates in.
- `identifier` - name of resource to create (or update)
- `secret`: Certificate store in Vault ([example](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/dsaas/routes/_wildcard.api.openshift.io)) (optional)

- `output_resource_name`: name of Kubernetes Secret to be created.
  - `output_resource_name` must be unique across a single namespace (a single secret can **NOT** contain multiple outputs).
  - If `output_resource_name` is not defined, the name of the secret will be `<identifier>-<provider>`.
    - For example, for a resource with `identifier` "my-ssl" and `provider` is set to `acm`, the created Secret will be called `my-ssl-acm`.
- `annotations`: additional annotations to add to the output resource

NOTE: Either `secret` or `domain_name` must be provided, but not both.  Use `secret` to import a certificate from vault, and `domain` for AWS to create a certifcate

Once the changes are merged, the certificate will be imported into ACM and a Kubernetes Secret will be created in the same namespace with all relevant details.

The Secret will contain the following fields:

- `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Certificate.
- `domain_name` - The name of the domain this Certification is valid for.
- `status` - The status of the Certificate.

If `secret` was set above, then these fields will also be included:
- `key` - Certificate private key.
- `certificate` - Certificate body.
- `caCertificate` - Certificate chain if provided.

#### Manage ElasticSearch via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

- `output_resource_name`: name of Kubernetes Secret to be created.
  - `output_resource_name` must be unique across a single namespace (a single secret can **NOT** contain multiple outputs).
  - If `output_resource_name` is not defined, the name of the secret will be `<identifier>-<provider>`.
    - For example, for a resource with `identifier` "my-service" and `provider` is set to `elasticsearch`, the created Secret will be called `my-service-elasticsearch`.
- `annotations`: additional annotations to add to the output resource

Once the changes are merged, the Amazon Elasticsearch Service will be created (or updated) and a Kubernetes Secret will be created in the same namespace with all relevant details.

The Secret will contain the following fields:

- `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the domain.
- `domain_id` - Unique identifier for the domain.
- `domain_name` - The name of the Elasticsearch domain.
- `endpoint` - Domain-specific endpoint used to submit index, search, and data upload requests.
- `kibana_endpoint` - Domain-specific endpoint for kibana without https scheme.
- `vpc_id` - If the domain was created inside a VPC, the ID of the VPC.

- `annotations`: additional annotations to add to the output resource
- `enhanced_monitoring`: (optional) Setting it to `true` will enable enhanced monitoring for the database instance. Learn more about enhanced monitoring [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_Monitoring.OS.html).
- `output_resource_db_name`: (optional) set the `db.name` key in the output Secret (does not affect actual terraform resource).
- `reset_password`: (optional) add or update this field to a random string to trigger a database password reset.
  - Note: removing this field will lead to a recycle of the pods using the output resource.
- `ca_cert`: (optional) specify `path`, `field` and `version` of a secret in vault containing a CA certificate to be added to the output Secret. Unless there is a good reason not to, use these settings:
  ```yaml
    ca_cert:
    path: app-interface/global/rds-ca-cert
    field: us-east-1 # region of the DB
    version: 2 # the latest available, search the repo for usage
  ```

Once the changes are merged, the RDS instance will be created (or updated) and a Kubernetes Secret will be created in the same namespace with following details.

- `db.host` - The hostname of the RDS instance.
- `db.port` - The database port.
- `db.name` - The database name.
- `db.user` - The master username for the database.
- `db.password` - Password for the master DB user.
- `db.ca_cert` - CA certificate for the DB (if `ca_cert` is defined).

##### Reset RDS database password

To reset the password of an RDS instance, add the `reset_password` field to the RDS definition according to the instructions in [Manage RDS databases via App-Interface](#manage-rds-databases-via-app-interface-openshiftnamespace-1yml).

Choose a value that represents a trace to why the password should be recycled (for example, a Jira ticket).

Note: You do not need to remove the `reset_password` field from the RDS definition once the password was recycled.

##### Create RDS database from Snapshot

You can create an RDS instance from a database snapshot by setting `snapshot_identifier` in your `defaults` file. However, most AppSRE tenants tend to use the same defaults file for multiple RDS instance. If you are re-using the defaults file, you can set `snapshot_identifier` in the `overrides`.

Here's an example of RDS database created from snapshot:

```yaml
terraformResources:
- provider: rds
  account: insights-prod
  identifier: system-baseline-prod
  defaults: /terraform/resources/insights/production/rds/rds-system-baseline-prod.yml
  overrides:
    snapshot_identifier: system-baseline-prod-migration
  parameter_group: /terraform/resources/insights/production/rds/postgres10-parameter-group-system-baseline-prod.yml
  output_resource_name: system-baseline-db-rds
  enhanced_monitoring: true
```

##### Publishing Database Log Files to CloudWatch

Database logs for MySQL and PostgreSQL can be configured to be published to CloudWatch where developers can look at the logs to identify & troubleshoot slow queries.

##### Publishing MySQL Logs to CloudWatch Logs

You can publish `audit`, `general`, `slowquery`, and `error` logs to CloudWatch for MySQL RDS instances by adding the following to your RDS specification file:

```yaml
enabled_cloudwatch_logs_exports: ["audit","error","general","slowquery"]
```

Amazon RDS publishes each MySQL database log as a separate database stream in the log group. For example, if you configure the export function to include the slow query log, slow query data is stored in a slow query log stream in the `/aws/rds/instance/my_instance/slowquery` log group.

Additonal details can be found in AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.MySQL.html).

##### Publishing PostgreSQL Logs to CloudWatch Logs

AWS does not break down RDS logs for PostgreSQL into `error`, `slowquery`, `audit`, etc. categories for logs. The only log options available for PostgreSQL RDS instances are `postgresql`, and `upgrade`.

To publish slow query logs to cloudwatch, we must first configure logging parameters for the RDS instance. RDS instance must be configured to use a custom parameter group. If this is not the case, we must first attach a custom parameter group to the database. To enable query logging for your PostgreSQL DB instance, set two parameters in the DB parameter group associated with your DB instance: `log_statement` and `log_min_duration_statement`.

The `log_statement` parameter controls which SQL statements are logged. We recommend that you set this parameter to `all` to log `all` statements when you debug issues in your DB instance. The default value is `none`. To log all data definition language (DDL) statements (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and so on), set this value to `ddl`. To log all DDL and data modification language (DML) statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and so on), set this value to `mod`.

The `log_min_duration_statement` parameter sets the limit in milliseconds of a statement to be logged. All SQL statements that run longer than the parameter setting are logged. This parameter is disabled and set to `-1` by default. Enabling this parameter can help you find unoptimized queries.

After you complete the configuration, Amazon RDS publishes the log events to log streams within a CloudWatch log group. For example, the PostgreSQL log data is stored within the log group `/aws/rds/instance/my_instance/postgresql`.

Additonal details can be found in AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_LogAccess.Concepts.PostgreSQL.html#USER_LogAccess.PostgreSQL.Query_Logging).

##### Configuring access policies for Performance Insights

To access Performance Insights you should have a `role` assigned to your user file with a `user_policies` section that includes a reference to a `performance-insights-access` AWS user policy.

If the policy does not exist for the AWS account, add it.

[Example](/data/aws/insights-prod/policies/PerformanceInsights.yml) for a `performance-insights-access` AWS policy.

Additional details can be found in AWS [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_PerfInsights.access-control.html).

- `annotations`: additional annotations to add to the output resource

Once the changes are merged, the resources will be created (or updated) and a Kubernetes Secret will be created in the same namespace with all relevant details.

The Secret will contain the following fields:
- `bucket` - The name of the bucket.
- `aws_region` - The name of the bucket's AWS region.
- `endpoint` - The url of the region's S3 endpoint.
- `aws_access_key_id` - The access key ID.
- `aws_secret_access_key` - The secret access key.
- `cloud_front_origin_access_identity_id` - The identifier for the distribution.
- `s3_canonical_user_id` - The Amazon S3 canonical user ID for the origin access identity.
- `distribution_domain` - The domain name corresponding to the distribution.
- `origin_access_identity` - The origin access identity in the form of `origin-access-identity/cloudfront/<cloud_front_origin_access_identity_id>`.

#### Manage CloudFront Public Keys via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

CloudFront Public Keys can be self-serviced via App-Interface.  Once created in AWS, the public key will need to be manually associated with a `Key group` and then that `Key group` manually associated with a CloudFront Distribution to sign URLs or cookies.

- `provider`: must be `s3-cloudfront-public-key`
- `account`: The AWS account you want to import certificates into.
- `identifier`: name of resource to create (or update)
- `secret`: Certificate store in Vault
  - `path`: vault path
  - `field`: `all`
  - `version`: (optional) for vault kv2
- `output_resource_name`: name of Kubernetes Secret to be created.
  - `output_resource_name` must be unique across a single namespace (a single secret can **NOT** contain multiple outputs).
  - If `output_resource_name` is not defined, the name of the secret will be `<identifier>-<provider>`.
    - For example, for a resource with `identifier` "my-key" and `provider` is set to `s3-cloudfront-public-key`, the created Secret will be called `my-key-s3-cloudfront-public-key`
- `annotations`: additional annotations to add to the output resource

The `secret` must have the key `cloudfront_public_key` that contains the public key to be uploaded to AWS.

Once the changes are merged, the public key will be imported into CloudFront Public Keys and a Kubernetes Secret will be created in the same namespace with all relevant details.

The Secret will contain the following fields:

- `id` - The AWS identifier for the public key.
- `etag` - The current version of the public key.
- `key` - The public key.

#### Manage CloudWatch Log Groups via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

CloudWatch Log Groups can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface.

In order to add or update an CloudWatch Log Group, you need to add them to the `terraformResources` field.

- `provider`: must be `cloudwatch`
- `account`: must be one of the AWS account names we manage. [Current options](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas/blob/main/schemas/openshift/namespace-1.yml#L502)
- `identifier` - name of resource to create (or update)
- `defaults`: path relative to [resources](/resources) to a file with default values. Note that it starts with `/`. [Current options:](/resources/terraform/resources/)
- `es_identifier`: identifier of a existing elasticsearch. It will create a AWS lambda to stream logs to elasticsearch service. This field is optional.
- `filter_pattern`: filter pattern for log data. Only works with streaming logs to elasticsearch.
- `output_resource_name`: name of Kubernetes Secret to be created.
  - `output_resource_name` must be unique across a single namespace (a single secret can **NOT** contain multiple outputs).
  - If `output_resource_name` is not defined, the name of the secret will be `<identifier>-<provider>`.
    - For example, for a resource with `identifier` "my-log-group" and `provider` "cloudwatch", the created Secret will be called `my-log-group-cloudwatch`.
- `annotations`: additional annotations to add to the output resource

Once the changes are merged, the CloudWatch Log Group will be created (or updated) and a Kubernetes Secret will be created in the same namespace with all relevant details.

The Secret will contain the following fields:
- `log_group_name` - The name of the CloudWatch Log Group.
- `aws_region` - The name of the Log group's AWS region.
- `aws_access_key_id` - The access key ID.
- `aws_secret_access_key` - The secret access key.

#### Manage Key Management Service Keys via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

Key Management Service keys can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface.

In order to add or update a Key Management Service key, you need to add them to the `terraformResources` field.

- `provider`: must be `kms`
- `account`: must be one of the AWS account names we manage. [Current options](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-schemas/blob/main/schemas/openshift/namespace-1.yml#L502)

- `defaults`: path relative to [resources](/resources) to a file with default values. Note that it starts with `/`. [Current options:](/resources/terraform/resources/)
- `output_resource_name`: name of Kubernetes Secret to be created.
  - `output_resource_name` must be unique across a single namespace (a single secret can **NOT** contain multiple outputs).
  - If `output_resource_name` is not defined, the name of the secret will be `<identifier>-<provider>`.
    - For example, for a resource with `identifier` "my-key" and `provider` "kms", the created Secret will be called `my-key-kms`.
- `annotations`: additional annotations to add to the output resource

Once the changes are merged, the Key Management Service key will be created (or updated) and a Kubernetes Secret will be created in the same namespace with all relevant details.

The Secret will contain the following fields:
- `key_id` - The globally unique identifier for the key.

#### Manage Kinesis Streams via App-Interface (`/openshift/namespace-1.yml`)

Kinesis Streams can be entirely self-services via App-Interface.

In order to add or update a Kinesis Stream, you need to add them to the `terraformResources` field.

- `provider`: must be `kinesis`
- `account`: must be one of the AWS account names we manage.
- `identifier` - name of resource to create (or update)
- `defaults`: path relative to [resources](/resources) to a file with default values. Note that it starts with `/`. [Current options](/resources/terraform/resources/)
- `output_resource_name`: name of Kubernetes Secret to be created.
  - `output_resource_name` must be unique across a single namespace (a single secret can **NOT** contain multiple outputs).
  - If `output_resource_name` is not defined, the name of the secret will be `<identifier>-<provider>`.
    - For example, for a resource with `identifier` "my-stream" and `provider` "kinesis", the created Secret will be called `my-stream-kinesis`.
- `annotations`: additional annotations to add to the output resource

Once the changes are merged, the Kinesis Stream will be created (or updated) and a Kubernetes Secret will be created in the same namespace with all relevant details.

The Secret will contain the following fields:
- `stream_name` - The name of the stream.
- `aws_region` - The name of the stream's AWS region.
- `aws_access_key_id` - The access key ID.
- `aws_secret_access_key` - The secret access key.

#### Manage VPC peerings via App-Interface (`/openshift/cluster-1.yml`)

VPC peerings can be entirely self-services via App-Interface.

A cluster can be peered to a VPC that is defined in app-interface (we call it an account VPC) or to another OCM cluster account VPC (we call it a cluster VPC)

In order to use this integration, the following must be defined in the cluster definition file, under the `peering` key

- `connections`: a list of peering connections that this cluster should have. A peering connection can be either to an `account VPC` or a `cluster VPC`
  - `provider`: One of `account-vpc`, `cluster-vpc-requester` or `cluster-vpc-accepter`
  - `name`: A name for the VPC peering connection (ex: `clusterA-cluster-B`)
  - `vpc` (mutually exclusive with `cluster`): Value as `$ref: /path/to/some/vpc.yaml` (of type `/aws/vpc-1.yml`) [Account VPC SOP](/docs/app-sre/sop/app-interface-cluster-vpc-peerings.md)
  - `cluster` (mutually exclusive with `vpc`): Value as `$ref: /path/to/some/cluster.yaml` (of type `/openshift/cluster-1.yml`)
  - `manageRoutes`: (optional) A boolean value indicating should the integration add appropriate routes to existing Route Tables.

**Note:** For a cluster-to-cluster VPC peering, both clusters MUST have a corresponding VPC peering definition, one of which defined as `cluster-vpc-requester` and one as `cluster-vpc-accepter`, each referencing the other cluster. This ensures we are very specific about peerings and don't end up creating peering requests that will not lead to an account that won't have a corresponding accepter.

Example:

```yaml
# hive-stage-01 cluster.yaml
...
peering:
  connections:
  - provider: account-vpc
    name: hive-stage-01_app-sre
    vpc:
      $ref: /aws/app-sre/vpcs/app-sre-vpc-02-ci-ext.yml
  - provider: cluster-vpc-requester
    name: hive-stage-01_app-sre-stage-01
    cluster:
      $ref: /openshift/app-sre-stage-01/cluster.yml
```

```yaml
# app-sre-stage-01 cluster.yaml
...
peering:
  connections:
  - provider: cluster-vpc-accepter
    name: app-sre-stage-01_hive-stage-01
    cluster:
      $ref: /openshift/hive-stage-01/cluster.yml
```

#### Manage Application Load Balancers via App-Interface (`/openshift/cluster-1.yml`)

Please follow the dev-guidelines: https://service.pages.redhat.com/dev-guidelines/docs/appsre/advanced/manage-application-load-balancer


### Manage Slack User groups via App-Interface

Slack User groups can be self-serviced via App-Interface.

To manage a User group via App-Interface:

1. **Create the slack group manually in CoreOS slack. There are two ways to do this:**

  - Edit and use a pre-existing placeholder group
    - There might be a few pre-created placeholder slack groups ready to be converted to new managed slack groups that can be renamed
    - The placeholder groups should be in the format - `@app-sre-placeholder-<n>` (where n={0, 1, 2...})
    - Edit the `group details` of one of the placeholder groups by changing the name and handle appropriately
    - If there is no placeholder slack group to use, email the slack admins as mentioned below
  - Request a slack group to be created by email
    - Follow the instructions in [this mojo document](https://mojo.redhat.com/docs/DOC-1217849#jive_content_id_Requesting_a_Slack_user_group) to send an email to the slack admins

2. **Add a `permission` file with the following details:**

- `name`: name for the permission
- `description`: description of the User group (currently not automated)
- `service`: `slack-usergroup`
- `handle`: the handle of the User group
- `workspace`: a reference to a file representing the Slack Workspace
- `pagerduty`: a reference to a file representing a PagerDuty target (Schedule or Escalation Policy).
  * Adding this attribute will add the PagerDuty target as an additional "source of truth", and will add the final schedule user to the Slack user group (in addition to any references from user files).
- `ownersFromRepos`: a list of urls of github or gitlab repositories containing
  the `OWNERS` files to extract `approvers`/`reviewers` from. Only the root
  `OWNERS` file is considered. The `OWNERS_ALIASES` is respected.
    - Note: optionally add `:<branch>` to use a specific branch. For example: `https://github.com/openshift/osde2e:main`.
- `schedule`: a reference to a file representing a schedule.
- `channels`: a list of channels to add to the User group

3. **Add this permission to the desired `roles`, or create a new `role` with this permission only (mandatory).**

4. **Add the group in the `managedUsergroups` section of the** [coreos slack](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/dependencies/slack/coreos.yml) **dependency file**

Examples:
* An example for the `app-sre-team` User group permission can be found [here](/data/teams/app-sre/permissions/app-sre-team-coreos-slack.yml)
* An example for a role that has this permission can be found [here](/data/teams/app-sre/roles/app-sre.yml)
* An example for the `app-sre-ic` User group permission which is also synced with a PagerDuty schedule can be found [here](/data/teams/app-sre/permissions/app-sre-ic-coreos-slack.yml)
* An example for a PagerDuty schedule file can be found [here](/data/dependencies/pagerduty/app-sre-primary.yml).
* An example for a PagerDuty escalation policy file can be found [here](/data/dependencies/pagerduty/app-sre-escalation-policy.yml).
* An example for a GitHub `OWNERS` file can be found [here](/data/teams/sd-sre/permissions/aws-account-operator-coreos-slack.yml).
* An example for a GitHub `OWNERS_ALIASES` file can be found [here](/data/teams/sd-sre/permissions/managed-velero-operator-coreos-slack.yml).
* An example for a schedule can be found [here](/data/teams/app-sre/schedules/app-sre-onboarding-ic.yml).

Notes:
* Please make sure that the slack user group exists in slack before creating the merge request, otherwise the automated build job will fail.
* In order to be able to use the `pagerduty` attribute of a `permission`, the relevant users (ones from that PagerDuty schedule) should have the following attributes in their user files:
  * `slack_username` - if it is different from `org_username`
  * `pagerduty_username` - if it is different from `org_username`

### Manage Jenkins jobs configurations using jenkins-jobs

Jenkins jobs configurations can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface, and allows to define JJB Manifests to be used to bring up CI/CD/Automation pipelines or adhoc jobs in the internal and external Jenkins instance.

Note: This used to be managed in the [JJB](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/jjb) repository.

To add a configuration to a Jenkins instance, add a `jenkins-config` object with the following details:
- `instance` - reference to a jenkins instance
- `type` - one of the following JJB entities:
  - `views`
  - `secrets`
  - `base-templates`
  - `job-templates`
  - `jobs`
- `config` - a list of configurations of type `view` or `project` (use `config` for `views` and `jobs` types)
- `config_path` - a path to a resource containing configuration (use `config_path` for `secrets` and `job-templates` types, which tend to be have a "complex" yaml)

Examples:
- `views` - [object](/data/services/app-interface/cicd/ci-int/views.yaml)
- `secrets` - [object](/data/services/app-interface/cicd/ci-int/secrets.yaml), [resource](/resources/jenkins/app-interface/secrets.yaml)
- `job-templates` - [object](/data/services/app-interface/cicd/ci-int/job-templates.yaml), [resource](/resources/jenkins/app-interface/jobs-templates.yaml)
- `jobs` - [object](/data/services/app-interface/cicd/ci-int/jobs.yaml)

All JJB configurations rely on a set of JJB entities for the corresponding Jenkins intance:
- `global` - [resources](/resources/jenkins/global/)
- `ci-int` - [object](/data/services/jenkins/cicd/ci-int/), [resources](/resources/jenkins/ci-int/)
- `ci-ext` - [object](/data/services/jenkins/cicd/ci-ext/), [resources](/resources/jenkins/ci-ext/)
- `ci-centos` - [object](/data/services/jenkins/cicd/ci-centos/), [resources](/resources/jenkins/ci-centos/)

The final JJB configrations will be sorted in the following order:
- `defaults`
- `global-defaults`
- `views`
- `secrets`
- `base-templates`
- `global-base-templates`
- `job-templates`
- `jobs`

External reference:
- [Jenkins Job Builder](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/)

Notes:
- To consume a secret from Vault, a KV v1 secret engine must be used.


### Delete AWS IAM access keys via App-Interface

AWS IAM keys deletion can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface.

In order to delete a key from an AWS account, add the Access key ID to the `deleteKeys` list in the AWS Account file.
For example, merging [this](/data/aws/osio/account.yml#L11) line will delete the Access key with ID `AKIAVT6AWJBAILFXBV4A` from the `osio` account.

One use case this is useful for is leaked keys.


### Reset AWS IAM user passwords via App-Interface

AWS IAM user passwords can be entirely self-serviced via App-Interface.

To reset a user's password in an AWS account, submit a MR with a new entry to the `resetPasswords` list in the AWS Account file:
```yaml
- user:
    $ref: /path/to/user/file.yaml
  requestId: <some_unique_value_without_spaces>
```

The user's new password should appear GPG encrypted within 30 minutes in app-interface-output: [terraform-users-credentials](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface-output/-/blob/master/terraform-users-credentials.md)

To decrypt password: `echo <password> | base64 -d | gpg -d - && echo` (you will be asked to provide your passphrase to unlock the secret)


Behind the scenes:

Once the MR is merged, an integration called `aws-iam-password-reset` will delete the user's login profile. At this point, the user can not login to the account.

A different integration, called `terraform-users` will realize that the user does not have a login profile and will re-create it. At this point, the user has a new random password.

The curious reader can follow #sd-app-sre-reconcile to see when these two actions have completed.

Once the new password is in place, it needs to be picked up by a app-interface-output by a qontract-cli command called `terraform-users-credentials` (the repository is refreshed once every 10 minutes).

### AWS garbage collection

To enable garbage collection in an AWS account, add `garbageCollection: true` to the account file. [example](/data/aws/osio-dev/account.yml#L20)

AWS resources which do *NOT* have one of the following properties are continuously garbage collected:

* The resource name starts with the name of an existing IAM user
* The resource name has `stage` or `prod` in it
* The resource has one of these tags:
  * `managed_by_integration` - resources managed by the `terraform-resources` or `terraform-users` integrations
  * `owner` - resources managed by `app-sre` team terraform configurations in [app-sre/infra](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/app-sre/infra/tree/master/terraform)
  * `aws_gc_hands_off` - resources created manually, if tag is set to `true`
  * `ENV`/`environment` - resources which are related to `stage` or `prod`

Supported resource types are:
* S3
* SQS
* RDS
* DynamoDB


### GitHub user profile compliance

App-Interface users must define a `github_username` field in their user file. This profile must comply with the following requirements:

* The profile `Company` field must contain `Red Hat` (regex expression: `^.*[Rr]ed ?[Hh]at.*$`)

### Manage GitLab group members

Adding, removing, and changing access levels of gitlab group members can be self-serviced via App-Interface

To manage a GitLab group via App-Interface:
1. Add a `permission` file with the following details:

- `name`: name for the permission
- `description`: description
- `service`: `gitlab-group-membership`
- `group`: name of GitLab Group
- `access`: access level this permission gives (owner/maintainer/developer/reporter/guest)

2. Add this permission to the desired `roles`, or create a new `role` with this permission only.

3. Add this permission to the GitLab bot role which can be found [here](/data/teams/app-sre/roles/app-sre-gitlab-bot.yml)

4. Make sure that ever member of the group has a role giving them permission to the group otherwise the integration will remove them.

Examples:
* An example for the `app-sre` group permission can be found [here](/data/dependencies/gitlab/permissions/app-sre-member.yml)
* An example for a role that has this permission can be found [here](/data/teams/app-sre/roles/app-sre.yml)

Notes:
* Creating new GitLab groups is not supported (GitLab group has to pre-exist).


### Create GitLab projects

Creating a new project in gitlab can be self-serviced via App-Interface.

To request the creation of a new project, submit a PR adding the new project under the desired group [here](/data/dependencies/gitlab/gitlab.yml). The project will be created on merge.

To get access to the project, if required, contact the App SRE team.


### Add a Grafana Dashboard

* Add (or update) the dashboard file (a ConfigMap containing the json data) in your service code repository. The dashboards must be in a separate directory, such as `/dashboards`.
  * Note: Each dashboard ConfigMap should have the following section under `metadata`:
    ```yaml
    labels:
      grafana_dashboard: "true"
    annotations:
      grafana-folder: /grafana-dashboard-definitions/<app_name>
    ```
    * `app_name` should be defined in the [grafana dashboards ConfigMap](/resources/observability/grafana/grafana-dashboards.configmap.yaml)

  * Note: [additional information](docs/app-sre/monitoring.md#Addingdashboards)

* Add a `resourceTemplate` entry in the your service's saas file to deploy your dashboard in staging, e.g.
  ```yaml
  - name: your-service-dashboards
    url: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service-registry/your-service
    path: /dashboards
    provider: directory
    targets:
    - namespace:
        $ref: /services/observability/namespaces/app-sre-observability-stage.yml
      ref: master
  ```
  * Note: remember to add `ConfigMap` to the `managedResourceTypes` section.
  * Note: with this configuration, every time you merge changes in your dashboard it will be deployed in stage. Read [this guide](/docs/app-sre/continuous-delivery-in-app-interface.md) to know more about saas files.

* Once your MR is merged, your dashboard will be deployed to stage and will be accessible in https://grafana.stage.devshift.net.

* Add a new target in the above resource template to deploy to prod, e.g.
  ```yaml
  targets:
  (...)
  - namespace:
      $ref: /services/observability/namespaces/app-sre-observability-production.yml
    ref: <your-service-repo-commit-sha>
  ```
  * Note: with this configuration, you can promote changes to your dashboards along with the code changes that created them.


### Execute a SQL Query on an App Interface controlled RDS instance

To execute an SQL Query, you have to commit to the app-interface an YAML
file with the following content:

```yaml
---
$schema: /app-interface/app-interface-sql-query-1.yml
name: <sql query unique name>
namespace:
  $ref: /services/<service>/namespaces/<namespace>.yml
identifier: <RDS resource identifier (same as defined in the namespace)>
output: <filesystem or stdout or encrypted>
# Required if output is encrypted
requestor: 
  $ref: <user-1.yml with public_gpg_key>
schedule: <if defined the output resource will be a CronJob instead of a Job>
query: <sql query>
```

If you want to run multiple queries in the same spec, you can define the
`queries` list instead of the `query` string. Example:

```yaml
---
$schema: /app-interface/app-interface-sql-query-1.yml
name: <sql query unique name>
namespace:
  $ref: /services/<service>/namespaces/<namespace>.yml
identifier: <RDS resource identifier (same as defined in the namespace)>
output: <filesystem or stdout or encrypted>
# Required if output is encrypted
requestor: 
  $ref: <user-1.yml with public_gpg_key>
schedule: < In UTC time - if defined the output resource will be a CronJob instead of a Job >
queries:
  - <sql query 1>
  - <sql query 2>
  - <sql query 3>
```

Example:

```yaml
---
$schema: /app-interface/app-interface-sql-query-1.yml
labels: {}
name: 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage
namespace:
  $ref: /services/ocm/namespaces/uhc-stage.yml
identifier: uhc-acct-mngr-staging
output: filesystem
query: |
  SELECT id, name, deleted_at from registries;
```

When that SQL Query specification is merged, the integration will create a
Job (or a CronJob if `schedule` is defined) in the namespace provided:

```bash
$ oc get pods | grep 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage
2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage-7pl6v              0/1     Completed   0          4h32m
```

That Job will execute the SQL query and place the result to the requested
location:

- `stdout`: requires `view` access to the namespace. The pod created by the Job
  will have the SQL query result printed to the stdout. Example:

```bash
$ oc logs 2020-01-28-account-manager-registries-stage-7pl6v
             id              |            name             |          deleted_at

- `filesystem`: requires `edit` access to the namespace. The pod created by the
  Job will have the SQL query result written to the pod filesystem. In the pod
  stdout you will see the `oc` command to retrieve the SQL query results.

```bash
$ oc logs 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage-cjh82
Get the sql-query results with:

oc cp 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage-cjh82:/tmp/query-result.txt 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage-cjh82-query-result.txt

Sleeping 3600s...
```

Notice that, in this case, the pod will be kept sleeping for 1 hour so you can
retrieve the query results.

Using that command:

```bash
$ oc rsh --shell=/bin/bash 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage-cjh82 cat /tmp/query-result.txt
             id              |            name             |          deleted_at

- `encrypted`: requires `view` access to the namespace. The pod created by the Job
  will have the SQL query result encrypted with requestor's public_gpg_key and 
  printed to the stdout.

```bash
$ oc logs 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage-cjh82
Get the sql-query results with:

cat <<EOF > 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage-cjh82-query-result.txt
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----

hQIMA4VLxbLWZXlwARAAopxeOIKmfRbsH/a12s35aClwjVb0hTbVvfT4jHXZJR9C
...
=jA8e
-----END PGP MESSAGE-----
EOF
gpg -d 2020-01-30-account-manager-registries-stage-cjh82-query-result.txt
```

Running that command locally and decrypt the message with requestor's private key.


Each Job will be automatically deleted after 7 days.

### Enable Gitlab Features on an App Interface Controlled Gitlab Repository

To manage a Gitlab repository via App Interface, you have to add an `upstream`
resource to the `codeComponents` section in your App. Example:

```yaml
---
$schema: /app-sre/app-1.yml

labels:
  service: app-sre

name: App-SRE

...

codeComponents:
...
- name: managed-tenants
  resource: upstream
  url: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/managed-tenants
...
```

App Interface has several features that can be enabled for the Gitlab
repositories:
- `gitlabRepoOwners`: Value `enabled: true` will enable the
  `gitlab-repo-owners`, integration, that evaluates the
  `OWNERS`/`OWNERS_ALIASES` files in that repository to post comments to the
  Merge Requests reporting the required approvals, ultimately labeling the
  Merge Request, making it up for auto-merge.
- `gitlabHousekeeping`:  Value `enabled: true` will enable the
  `gitlab-housekeeping` integration, that auto-merges Merge Requests that are
  labelled as such. It also rebases the Merge Requests that are not rebased
  (you can disable the rebase feature with `rebase: false`). Additional supported
  fields:
    - `limit` - limit number of merges/rebases to avoid load (default: 1)
    - `days_interval` - number of days to consider an item as stale (default: 15)
    - `enable_closing` - enable closing of stale items after two stale periods (default: disabled)
    - `pipeline_timeout` - number of minutes that determine if a pending pipeline is to be canceled.
    If not set, no pipeline will be canceled.
- `jira`: Value as `$ref: /path/to/jira-server.yaml` will enable the
  Gitlab/JIRA integration, that links Merge Requests mentioning JIRA tickets
  to the mentioned JIRA ticket.

Example:

```yaml
codeComponents:
...
- name: managed-tenants
  resource: upstream
  url: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/managed-tenants
  gitlabRepoOwners:
    enabled: true
  gitlabHousekeeping:
    enabled: true
    rebase: false
  jira:
    $ref: /dependencies/jira/issues-redhat-com.yaml
...
```

### Provision and consume Kafka clusters via KAS Fleet Manager

Provisioning Kafka managed clusters through the Kafka Service Fleet Manager can be self-serviced via app-interface.

To provision a new cluster, create a Kafka cluster file. Example:
```yaml
---
$schema: /kafka/cluster-1.yml

labels: {}

name: example-kafka
description: <cluster description>

ocm:
  $ref: /dependencies/ocm/production.yml

spec:
  provider: aws
  region: us-east-1
  multi_az: true
```

To define a consumer of the Kafka cluster, add the `kafkaCluster` reference to a namespace file. Example:
```yaml
kafkaCluster:
  $ref: /kafka/example-kafka/cluster.yml
```

To explicitly indicate that your service relies on the Kafka service, add the `kafka` dependency in the App file:
```yaml
dependencies:
# existing dependencies
- $ref: /dependencies/kafka/service.yml
```

This will result in a Secret being created in the consuming namespace. The Secret will be called `kafka` and it will contain the following keys:
- `bootstrapServerHost` - Bootstrap server hostname (host:port)
- `clientID` - Client ID to use for authentication
- `clientSecret` - Client Secret to use for authentication
