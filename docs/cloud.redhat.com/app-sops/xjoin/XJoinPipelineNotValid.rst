Impact
------

A XJoin pipeline is considered valid if the level of consistency of host records in the HBI database compared to ElasticSearch index is over a given threshold (99%).
If the consistency level is below the given threshold the pipeline is considered invalid.
As a result, the given application may present incorrect information to the customers.


Summary
-------

The host records in the ElasticSearch index became out of sync.

Access required
---------------

-  Console access to the cluster+namespace pods are running in.

Steps
-----

If a pipeline becames out of sync the XJoin Operator automatically refreshes the pipeline by re-reading all the records from the HBI database.
If that does not resolve the inconsistency the operator keeps on retrying until consistency is restored.

- Log into the console / namespace
- Verify that a pipeline refresh has been attempted :code:`oc describe xjoin <pipeline name>`

If pipeline refreshes are being attempted over and over but the consistency level falls short of the threshold this may be an indication that a piece of the pipeline is out of sync.
In that case reach out to `platform-inventory-dev <https://app.slack.com/client/T026NJJ6Z/CA0SL3420/user_groups/SQ7EM63N0>`_.
