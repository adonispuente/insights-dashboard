`Incident Response Doc`_ for cloud.redhat.com

Impact
------

-  Image Builder is a service used to build images. It acts as an interface for composer.

Summary
-------

This alert fires when the compose request, the request to build an image, errors
out too much.

Access required
---------------

-  Access to the `(Production|Stage) Openshift cluster`_ to view the image-builder-(prod|stage) namespace.
-  Access to the `Kibana instance`_ in order to review logs.
-  Access to the `(Production|Stage) Grafana instance`_ to see the current failure rate on the dashboard.

Steps
-----

-  Check the dashboard for a quick status.
-  Check logs / events for pods in the image-builder-(prod|stage) namespace.
-  Check where the errors are occuring, either in Image Builder or in the Composer
   service it depends on.

Escalations
-----------

-  Ping the engineering team who own the app (#osbuild on CoreOS Slack), preferably with any logs or data that you were able to gather.
