## ACS Central provisioning latency

### Impact

ACS Fleet Manager service is experiencing issue while provisioning ACS centrals.

### Summary

ACS Fleet Manager is not able to perform acs central provisioning normally and is not able to handle the load.

### Access required

- OSD Console access to the cluster that runs the ACS Fleet Manager.
- - OSD Console access to the cluster that runs the Fleetshard-sync service.
- Access to cluster resources: Pods/Deployments/Events

### Steps

- Check if the ACS Fleet Manager pods are running and verify the logs.
    ```
    #example
    oc get pods -n <acs-fleet-manager-stage|acs-fleet-manager-production>

    acs-fleet-manager-<pod_id>   1/1     Running
    acs-fleet-manager-<pod_id>   1/1     Running
    acs-fleet-manager-<pod_id>   1/1     Running

    # Check the pod logs to investigate possible causes of the latency: look for Error/Exception message.

    oc logs acs-fleet-manager-<pod_id>  | less
    ```
  check the log to ensure Fleet Manager worker is started: there is exactly one Fleet Manager leader running.
    ```
    oc logs <pod-name> | grep 'Running as the leader.*FleetManager'

    You should see output similar to the below from either one of the pods:
    "Running as the leader and starting worker *workers.Worker"
    ```
- Check if the Fleetshard-sync services pods are running and verify the logs.
    ```
    #example
    oc get pods -n <fleetshard-sync-stage|fleetshard-sync-production>

    fleetshard-sync-<pod_id>   1/1     Running

    # Check the pod logs to investigate possible causes of the latency: look for Error/Exception message.

    oc logs fleetshard-sync-<pod_id>  | less
    ```
  check the log to ensure Fleetshard-sync is started and reconcile loops start for requested centrals.
    ```
    oc logs <pod-name> | grep 'Start reconcile central'

    You should see output similar to the below:
    "Start reconcile central <central_name>"
    ```
- How to handle:
    - Error/exception appears related to Fleet Manager API or no leader worker is running, try to restart the pods.
    - Error/exception appears related to Fleetshard-sync check with ACS team Data Plane support.
    - Otherwise, or if unsure about the reason, escalate the issue to the Control Plane team.

## ACS rotate Central tenant certificate

### Impact

If not rotated before expiration, ACS tenant UI returns invalid TLS certificates.

### Summary
ACS Fleet Manager service provides TLS key and certificate for managed ACS central tenant UI endpoints. This certificate is a wildcard certificate with CN: `*.acs.rhlcoud.com` or `*.acs-stage.rhcloud.com`. The certificates are valid for a year. This SOP describes how to rotate the certificate before it expires.
### Access Required

- App interface Vault ([Prod](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/acs-fleet-manager/prod)/[Stage](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/acs-fleet-manager/stage))
### Steps

1. Grab the .tls key for your environment from app-interface vault (VPN required)
    - [Prod](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/acs-fleet-manager/prod/service/dataplane-certificate)
    - [Stage](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/acs-fleet-manager/stage/service/dataplane-certificate)
    - Store it in a file `tls.key`
1. Create a CSR
    ```
    openssl req -new -key tls.key -out tls.csr

    Country Name (2 letter code) []:US
    State or Province Name (full name) []:North Carolina
    Locality Name (eg, city) []:Raleigh
    Organization Name (eg, company) []:Red Hat\, Inc.
    Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
    Common Name (eg, fully qualified host name) []:*.acs.rhcloud.com or *.acs-stage.rhlcoud.com depending on the environment
    Email Address []:rhacs-eng-ms@redhat.com
    ```
1. Create a service now ticket using [this Form](https://redhat.service-now.com/help?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=e5fc3a19db0898149693cf5e13961975&sysparm_category=bce7f09b4fa25b40220104c85210c7a0&sc_catalog=1a98389b4fa25b40220104c85210c7d4)
    - Select application ID ACSC-001: Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security (Managed Service)
    - Select ticket of reference, for prod: `RITM1256415` , for stage: `RITM1245441`
    - Fill additional Information with:
      ```
      We (RHACS Cloud Service) have an existing wildcard Digicert certificate, issued by Red Hat IT, which needs to be rotated.
      The request here is for new certificates for our <environment> environment. The domain is:
      
      <domain>

      The existing certificates will need to continue to be valid while we switch to the new certificates.

      The .csr is attached to this ticket.
      ```
    - Attach the .csr file to the ticket
1. Wait for cert to be attached to the ticket and download the zip file
1. Unzip the certificates and generate the tls.crt file
    ```
    unzip <zip-file-name> 
    cat ./<unzipped_folder/star_acs[-stage]_rhcloud_com.pem DigiCertCA2.pem > tls.crt       
    ```
1. Validate certificate:
    - Check that cert, key and csr have the same checksum
      ```
      openssl req -pubkey -in tls.csr -noout | openssl sha256
      openssl x509 -pubkey -in star_acs_rhcloud_com.pem -noout | openssl sha256
      openssl pkey -pubout -in tls.key | openssl sha256
      ```
    - Check that dates are valid
      ```
      openssl x509 -noout -in tls.crt -dates

      Output: 
      notBefore=Jun 16 00:00:00 2023 GMT
      notAfter=Jun 18 23:59:59 2024 GMT
      ```
    - Check that domains is correct
      ```
      cat tls.crt | openssl x509 -text | grep DNS
      
      Output:
      DNS:*.acs.rhcloud.com
      ```
1. Put content of `tls.crt` as new secret version in app-interface vault ([Prod](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/acs-fleet-manager/prod/service/dataplane-certificate)/[Stage](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-interface/show/acs-fleet-manager/stage/service/dataplane-certificate))
1. Change the secret version reference in acs-fleet-manager configuration ([Prod](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/acs-fleet-manager/namespaces/acs-fleet-manager-production-app-sre-prod-04.yml?ref_type=heads#L37)/[Stage](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/acs-fleet-manager/namespaces/acs-fleet-manager-stage.yml#L37))

## Status page

The ACS cloud service publishes its operational status under `console.redhat.com` + `Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security Cloud Service`
on [status.redhat.com](https://status.redhat.com). The status page integration is managed via app-interface as documented by the
[dev-guidelines](https://service.pages.redhat.com/dev-guidelines/docs/appsre/advanced/statuspage/).

The ACS status page currently displays a hard coded status, which defaults to `operational`. In case of an incident, the incident commander
should [update the status page](https://service.pages.redhat.com/dev-guidelines/docs/appsre/advanced/statuspage/#define-a-status) depending
on the nature of the incident:

* `operational`
* `under_maintenance`
* `degraded_performance`
* `partial_outage`
* `major_outage`

The status level during an incident is based primarily on the level of customer impact. Ultimately all parties involved
in the incident handling determine the appropriate status. Some examples include:

- ACS fleet manager is slow to respond to requests in relation to its latency targets.
  - Status `degraded_performance` makes sense here.
- A single ACS Central tenant is down.
  - Status `partial_outage` makes sense here.
- ACS fleet manager does not respond at all to requests.
  - Status `major_outage` makes sense here.
- ACS fleet manager or services it depends on are under maintenance
  - Status `under_maintenance` makes sense here.

Example of merge request modifying the status can be found [here](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/55703).
