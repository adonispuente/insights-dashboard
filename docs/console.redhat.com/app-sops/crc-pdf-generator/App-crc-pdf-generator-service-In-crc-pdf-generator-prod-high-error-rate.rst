================================================================

Severity: Pagerduty
-------------------

`Incident Response Doc`_ for console.redhat.com

Impact
------

- The crc PDF generator is used to generate PDF reports for console.redhat.com services.
- If the error rate is high, there might be an impact on the API availability. Users might not be able to generate reports.

Summary
-------

Note: This service is deployed via `Clowder`_

This alert is triggered if more than 10% of API responses return an error with 5xx codes. This can be a problem for the Availability SLO.

Access required
---------------

- Console access to the cluster and namespace in which pods are running


Steps
-----

- Log in to the console, open "crc-pdf-generator-prod" namespace and verify if all pods are running and receiving requests.
- Check logs/events for generator pods.
- Check if any deployments or changes in the application happened closer to the time the requests started to return errors.
- Check infrastructure metrics on the OpenShift console for generator service (Deployments -> crc-pdf-generator-api -> Metrics) and take notes.
- Escalate the alert with all the information available to the engineering team that is responsible for the app.

Escalations
-----------

-  Ping development team using @crc-experience-team group in Internal Red Hat Slack
