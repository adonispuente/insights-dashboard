## Impact
Customer facing API doesn't work properly so there's a visible outage in the service.

## Summary
This alert fires when malware-detection availability SLO has been breached,
which occurs when the ratio of 5xx HTTP response codes is > 0.1 (10%) of the total responses.

## Access required
Console access to the cluster+namespace pods are running in.

## Steps
1. Log into the console / namespace and verify if all malware-detection-api pods are running / stuck / erroring out / etc.
2. Inspect malware-detection-api pod logs and events.
3. Check if any deployments or changes in the application happened closer to the time the error started.
4. Escalate the alert with all the information available to the engineering team that is responsible for the app.
