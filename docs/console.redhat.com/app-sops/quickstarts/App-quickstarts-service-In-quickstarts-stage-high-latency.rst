Severity: Pagerduty
-------------------

`Incident Response Doc`_ for console.redhat.com

Impact
------

- Quickstarts service provides persistent storage for guided user tours in console.redha.com.
- If the latency is high, there might be an impact on the latency SLO, and user experience might be degraded.

Summary
-------

Note: This service is deployed via `Clowder`_

This alert fires when more than 10% of the API responses have latency greater than 2000ms

Access required
---------------

- Console access to the cluster and namespace in which pods are running

Steps
-----
- Log in to the console, open "quickstarts-stage" namespace and verify if all pods are running and receiving requests.
- Check logs/events for Quickstarts pods.
- Check if any deployments or changes in the application happened closer to the time the requests started to return errors.
- Check infrastructure metrics on the OpenShift console for quickstarts service (Deployments -> quickstarts-service -> Metrics) and take notes.
- Escalate the alert with all the information available to the engineering team responsible for the app.

Escalations
-----------
