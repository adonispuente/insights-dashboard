# Basic check whether application is running

## Browser

Go to [Vulnerability page on consoledot](https://console.redhat.com/insights/vulnerability/cves). If you're not logged in you will be prompted to log in.
On the CVEs page you whould list of CVEs applying to your account and in case when all systems are up to date the list might be empty you might want to disable the filter which is enabled by default for systems exposed (1 or more), this is done easily using the filter chip on the page. Without filter for systems exposed there should be about 12k CVEs (this number changes with each new CVE published) in total and 20 on the page. The CVEs in the list are clickable and will bring user to CVE details page. Alternatively systems tab in the sidenav can be viewed assuming there are systems connected with Insights using the account used for viewing the pages so in same cases the list might be empty with a quick how to about registering systems in Insights. Default filtering might have to be disabled just like on the CVE list page.
In case there are no systems registered within Insights under your account you should a screen advising how you can connect your systems to the Insights. This is a proof of basic funcionality as well as in order to display this page some database queries had to be made on the backend.

## Terminal
`curl -ski -X GET -u "${LOGIN}:${PWD}" https://cloud.redhat.com/api/vulnerability/v1/apistatus`
Where `${LOGIN}` is your https://sso.redhat.com login/email and `${PWD}` is your password.  You need to figure out whether to use your login as `${LOGIN} (e.g. rhn-engineering-jdoe) or your email as `${LOGIN}` (e.g. jdoe@redhat.com), as it's been reported login works for majority of users but for some users it does not (usage of login results in authentication failire) and these users had to use their email. This inconsitency is caused by SSO and there's nothing Vulnerability can do about it.
200 is expected HTTP code.
408 indicated API outage (timeout).
503 issue with connection to the database.
Example of expected output:
```
curl -ski -X GET -u "${LOGIN}:${PWD}" https://cloud.redhat.com/api/vulnerability/v1/apistatus
