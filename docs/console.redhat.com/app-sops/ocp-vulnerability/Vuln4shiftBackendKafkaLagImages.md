Severity: Pagerduty

## Incident Response Plan
 [Incident Response Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyEQnL4B11w7zXwum8Boty2IipMIxoFw1ri1UZB6xJE) for console.redhat.com

## Impact
OCP Vulnerability application is not able to process new cluster uploads or is processing them very slowly which means that information is shown late or not at all.

## Summary
This alert fires when OCP Vulnerability component responsible for processing messages regarding new uploads coming from the insights-operator doesn't keep with new messages and so Kafka lag increases too much.

## Access required
Console access to the cluster+namespace pods are running in.

## Steps
1. Check Vulnerability grafana board "Kafka aconsumer lag" chart.
 - Topic `ccx.image.sha.results` lag means `vuln4shift-backend-digest-writer` components issues.
2. Log into the console / namespace and verify if all `vuln4shift-backend-digest-writer` pods are running and processing incoming messages.
3. Inspect given components pods logs and search for error logs.
4. If there are no errors in the logs observe the Kafka lag for a while to see it decreases at reasonable rate.
5. Check if any deployments or changes in the application happened closer to the time the error started.
6. Escalate the alert with all the information available to the engineering team that is responsible for the app.
