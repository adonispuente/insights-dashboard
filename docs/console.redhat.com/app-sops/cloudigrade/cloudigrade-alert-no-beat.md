# cloudigrade alert no beat

Severity: High

## Incident Response Plan

[Incident Response Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AyEQnL4B11w7zXwum8Boty2IipMIxoFw1ri1UZB6xJE) for console.redhat.com

## Impact

cloudigrade inspects images in public clouds to identify RHEL presense and tracks customer use to report on RHEL usage. If cloudigrade is broken, customers will not have accurate data reported via Subscription Watch. If `cloudigrade-beat` specifically is not running, cloudigrade's scheduled periodic tasks will not run, and therefore cloudigrade's data will be stale, resulting in incorrect customer-facing data.

## Summary

This alert fires when there has been no `cloudigrade-beat` pod with a ready status for 5 minutes.

## Access required

Console access to the cluster+namespace pods are running in.

## Steps

1. Log into the console / namespace and verify if any `cloudigrade-beat` pod is running.
2. Inspect given cloudigrade pods logs and search for error logs.
3. Check if any deployments or changes in the application happened closer to the time the error started.
4. Escalate the alert with all the information available to the engineering team that is responsible for the app.
