# SOP : Service Registry Service Fleet Manager

## SRS Fleet Manager Down

### Impact

No incoming request can be received or processed. 
The existing registered Service Registry provisioning jobs will not be able to be processed.  
Users will not be able to retrieve their Service Registry instances status and connection details.
Service Registry UI in console.redhat.com will not work properly, because of errors in API calls.

### Summary

SRS Fleet Manager (all of the replicas or pods) are down.

### Access required

- OSD console access to the cluster that runs the SRS Fleet Manager.
- Access to cluster resources: Pods/Deployments/Events

### Relevant secrets

### Steps

- Check Deployments/srs-fleet-manager: check details page to make sure pods are configured and started; make sure pod number is configured to default: 3.
- Check cluster event logs to ensure there is no abnormality in the cluster level that could impact SRS Fleet Manager API.
  - Search Error/exception events with keywords "SRS Fleet Manager " and with text "image", "deployment" etc.
- Investigate the metrics in Grafana for any possible evidences of the crash.
  - Application: Volume, Latency, Error
      - Stage: https://grafana.stage.devshift.net/d/Tbw1Eg2Mz/srs-fleet-manager-metrics?var-datasource=app-sre-stage-01-prometheus&var-namespace=service-registry-stage

## SRS Fleet Manager availability

### Impact

Users are getting numerous amount of errors on API requests.

### Summary

SRS Fleet Manager is not performing normally and is returning an abnormally high number of 5xx Error requests.

### Access required

- OSD Console access to the cluster that runs the SRS Fleet Manager .
- Access to cluster resources: Pods/Deployments

### Relevant secrets

### Steps

- Investigate the metrics in Grafana for any possible cause of the issue
  - Application: Volume, Latency, Error
      - Stage: https://grafana.stage.devshift.net/d/Tbw1Eg2Mz/srs-fleet-manager-metrics?var-datasource=app-sre-stage-01-prometheus&var-namespace=service-registry-stage
      - Production: https://grafana.app-sre.devshift.net/d/Tbw1Eg2Mz/srs-fleet-manager-metrics?var-datasource=app-sre-prod-04-prometheus&var-namespace=service-registry-production

- If there are container performance issue are identified (e.g.: CPU spike, high Latency etc), increase the number of replicas.
- Sentry -- https://sentry.devshift.net/sentry/service-registry-production/
- Check Deployments/srs-fleet-manager, check details page to make sure pods are configured and started. Start the pod if none is running (default:3).
- Check if the SRS Fleet Manager pods are running and verify the logs.
    ```
    #example
    oc get pods -n <service-registry-stage|service-registry-production>

    srs-fleet-manager-58f7b8b649-2mgcp   1/1     Running
    srs-fleet-manager-58f7b8b649-blf5h   1/1     Running
    srs-fleet-manager-58f7b8b649-lzxms   1/1     Running

    # Check the pod logs to investigate possible causes of the issue (e.g. look for any Error/Exception messages)

    oc logs srs-fleet-manager-58f7b8b649-2mgcp  | less
