# AppSRE Initiatives

An Initiative is a process that allows AppSRE to build long term plans collaboratively and asynchronously and to share context and knowledge.

It is intended to provide a way to structure a set of work items in a sequential form that can be executed step by step.

Full design document can be found [here](/docs/app-sre/design-docs/initiative-process.md).
