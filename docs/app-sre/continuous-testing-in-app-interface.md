# Continuous Testing in App-interface

App-interface is a declarative interface to define everything.
Service owners are able to define their post deployment tests using a SaaS file.

## Overview

This SaaS file should deploy resources of kind `Job` to the same namespace as the application. The deployment of the Jobs should only be carried out after the application was deployed successfully.

## Job definition and naming
Jobs to deploy should be defined in a separate OpenShift template with one of these naming approaches:
* `<your-job-id>-${IMAGE_TAG}` will run on every update to the source code where a new container image is built.
* `<your-job-id>-${IMAGE_TAG}-{JOBID}` same as above + allows job reruns from openshift console (tekton PipelineRuns)

Jobs need to have a new name on every run to be created, if the name does not change, the job is not created, hence, it does not run.
`{JOBID}` parameter is a tweak to ensure the `Job` name changes even though the `{IMAGE_TAG}` does not. This is useful in testing stages
 when there could be flaky tests and re-running them is desirable. Maintaining the `IMAGE_TAG` is worh to know the image being tested.

 Example:
 ```yaml
---
parameters:
[...]
- name: JOBID
  generate: expression
  from: "[0-9a-f]{7}"
- name: IMAGE_TAG
  value: ''
  required: true
apiVersion: v1
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: myservice-tests-template
objects:
- apiVersion: batch/v1
  kind: Job
  metadata:
    name: myservice-tests-${IMAGE_TAG}-${JOBID}
```
### Notes:
* The jobs from the previous round will be deleted automatically
## Define post-deployment testing SaaS file

In order to define Continuous Testing pipelines in app-interface:

1. Define a SaaS file with a structure according to the [SaaS file structure](/docs/app-sre/continuous-delivery-in-app-interface.md#saas-file-structure), with the following specifications:
    * `managedResourceTypes` - should be only `Job`
    * `publishJobLogs` - (optional) if this is a [saas file running post-deployment tests](), set this to `true` to publish Jobs' pods logs.

2. Define an [automated promotion](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/docs/app-sre/continuous-delivery-in-app-interface.md#automatedgated-promotions) based on the results of the stage deployment.
    * Note: The usage of `upstream` to link post-deployment tests to a deployment job should be updated to use automated promotions. For more information: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/19968

A complete example for github-mirror can be found [here](/data/services/github-mirror/cicd/test.yaml).

### Tests Re-runs (tekton)
Sometimes test stages fail due to flaky tests or by other reasons and rerunning them could improve the overall ci/cd system:
* It prevents commits/parameters to just trigger pipelines without any change
* It saves time rebuilding images and/or running unnecessary previous steps

To enable `Job` reruns, the `Job` name must change in every deployment even though there is no image change. If the name does not change, the integration does not detect any change and the job won't trigger because it already exists.
To ensure the `Job` has a new name on every run, `templates` have an option to generate a random string parameter that can be attached to the `Job` name:

### Define post-deployment testing for resources behind the Red Hat VPN

There may be use cases where tests need to access resources behind the Red Hat VPN, such as the OCM UI.

In order to run tests behind the VPN:

1. Create a namespace on the `appsres03ue1` cluster. Call the namespace the same as the app's stage namespace, including `-tests`.
    * Example: if the stage namespace is called `github-mirror-stage`, the internal tests namespace should be called `github-mirror-stage-tests`.
1. Follow the same process as mentioned above to create a SaaS file and automated promotions.
    * Note: the `pipelinesProvider` must be a reference to a provider behind the VPN as well (pipelines namespace should be in the `appsrep05ue1` cluster).
1. It is recommended to split the OpenShift template between tests that will run within the service namespace and tests that will run in the internal tests namespace.
