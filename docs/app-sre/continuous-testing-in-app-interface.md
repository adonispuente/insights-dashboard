# Continuous Testing in App-interface

App-interface is a declarative interface to define everything.
Service owners are able to define their post deployment tests using a SaaS file.

## Overview

This SaaS file should deploy resources of kind `Job` to the same namespace as the application. The deployment of the Jobs should only be carried out after the application was deployed successfully.

The Jobs to deploy should be defined in a separate OpenShift template, and each Job name should end with `-{IMAGE_TAG}` so the jobs will be recreated after every update to the source code. The jobs from the previous round will be deleted automatically.

## Define post-deployment testing SaaS file

In order to define Continuous Testing pipelines in app-interface:

1. Define a SaaS file with a structure according to the [SaaS file structure](/docs/app-sre/continuous-delivery-in-app-interface.md#saas-file-structure), with the following specifications:
    * `managedResourceTypes` - should be only `Job`
    * `publishJobLogs` - (optional) if this is a [saas file running post-deployment tests](), set this to `true` to publish Jobs' pods logs.

2. Define an [automated promotion](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/docs/app-sre/continuous-delivery-in-app-interface.md#automatedgated-promotions) based on the results of the stage deployment.

A complete example for github-mirror can be found [here](/data/services/github-mirror/cicd/test.yaml).
