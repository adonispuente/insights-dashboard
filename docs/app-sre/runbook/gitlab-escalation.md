## Overview

The service is only accessible via Red Hat VPN and is used to manage the source code of non public-facing code, including App Interface.
AppSRE has a large reliance on GitLab and have an [existing SOP in place if GitLab is down](./../sop/app-interface-gitlab-down.md).

    - Keep an eye on the Sidekiq queue. In [APPSRE-5772](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSRE-5772), our integrations were responsible for a huge increase in the Sidekiq queue which degraded the performance of the service.
