# Jenkins

[TOC]

## Overview

Currently we have two Jenkins https://ci.int.devshift.net/ and https://ci.ext.devshift.net/(usually referred as ci-int and ci-ext), hosting and running CI pipelines that are both serving App SRE and as our service to tenants. ci-int can only be accessed through VPN, while ci-ext is public accessible(through Red Hat SSO). They are both on AWS.



## Troubleshooting

Prerequisite: Make sure you can ssh into Jenkins workers by first following all the ssh set up in [AAA doc](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/blob/master/docs/app-sre/AAA.md), then test it by running `ssh ci-int-jenkins-node-01-app-sre` for example. Note that we use bastion as jump box to access ci-ext worker. A common error is having different username in local than remote, in that case, add `User [yourremoteusername]` in your ssh config file. For example:
```
Host ci-ext-jenkins-worker-*
    User     yourremoteusername
    ProxyCommand ssh -W %h:%p yourremoteusername@ci.ext.ssh.devshift.net
    # Change if different private key file:
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
Host ci-int-aws-jenkins-worker-*
    User     yourremoteusername
    Hostname %h.int.devshift.net
    # Change if different private key file:
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
Note that for ci-ext, the internal IP's last field's number minus 9 is the node number. For example, if you see PagerDuty alert `PredictNodeDiskFull app-sre-prod-01 ci-ext (/dev/nvme1n1p1 production 192.168.18.14:9100`, the node is having problem is `14 - 9 = 5`, therefore ci-ext-jenkins-node-05-app-sre is what you want.


### Useful command lines:

`du -sh /* | sort -h`: Sort the folders by they disk space they take. 

`cd /tmp && rm -rf *`: Use only when it is necessary, this command free up space if disk is still full even after dangling containers and images were pruned.

`docker system prune`: Prune unused containers and images, usually freeing a lot of space.

## Known Issues

The workers disk space fills up from time to time despite [existing clean-up job](https://ci.int.devshift.net/job/jenkins-workers-cleanup/2545/console). Tracked by [APPSRE-4725](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/APPSRE-4725).
