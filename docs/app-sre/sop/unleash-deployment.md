# Unleash Deployment

Tenants will request an instance of Unleash following the
[steps here](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/dev-guidelines/-/blob/master/content/en/docs/AppSRE/Advanced/feature-toggles.md).

This document describes how to deploy the requested instance using App
Interface.

## Architecture

Unleash is deployed as a regular Service/Deployment to the `unleash` Namespace
in the OpenShift Cluster. It consumes three Secrets:

- [Configuration Secret](#configuration-secret)
- [Database Access Secret](#database)
- [Client Access Token Secret](#client-access-token-secret)

![](images/arch.png)

Clients can access Unleash using the Web UI, that authenticates users against
Github (validating the Organization and the Team) or via client API, using the
[Client Access Token Secret](#client-access-token-secret).

## Naming Conventions

Considering that the Unleash instance created in the `unleash` Namespace and
will be consumed by a given application, the naming convention used throughout
this document will always relate the Unleash instance to the application. Some
examples:

- `path: <secret>/unleash/<application-name>-config`
- `output_resource_name: <application-name>-unleash-rds`
- `path: <secret>/unleash/<application-name>-unleash-token`

This convention allows the Unleash Namespace of a given Cluster to have
multiple Unleash instances, each serving different applications running on the
same Cluster.

Similarly, the URL for the Unleash instance will be:

```
https://<application-name>.unleash.devshift.net
```

## Github Configuration

Login to Github using the app-sre-bot account then create a new Github OAuth
application [here](https://github.com/settings/applications/new), filling the
details of the new Unleash application. Example:

![](images/gh_newapp.png)

**NOTE:** The `Authorization callback URL` is always the instance URL followed
by `/api/auth/callback`.

After clicking `Register application`, you will be given the `Client ID`
and the `Client Secret`. Those values will be placed in the
[Configuration Secret](#configuration-secret), described ahead.

## Github Org/Team

Users will be given access to the Unleash instance Web UI via Github ORG/TEAM
membership. To set that using App Interface, create a new
`<application-name>.yml` file in the `unleash`
[permissions directory](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/tree/master/data/dependencies/unleash/permissions),
containing:

```yaml
---
$schema: /access/permission-1.yml

labels: {}

name: <application-name>-unleash
description: <application-name> unleash instance access

service: github-org-team
org: app-sre
team: <application-name>-unleash
```

And add that permission to the proper team `role` (tenants are expected to
inform the team/users in the JIRA ticket).

## Namespace

All the Unleash instances are deployed to a dedicated `unleash` Namespace. The
Cluster will be chosen by the AppSRE Team, according to application consuming
the instance.

The `app-sre-prod-01` already has an `unleash` Namespace. If you're going to
create the new Unleash instance in that Namespace, you can skip this section.

To create the Unleash namespace in a given Cluster, add the Namespace
manifest `<cluster-name>.yml` to the
[namespaces directory](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/tree/master/data/services/unleash/namespaces)
of the Unleash service.

The Namespace manifest will initially contain:

```yaml
---
$schema: /openshift/namespace-1.yml

labels: {}

name: unleash
description: namespace for unleash

cluster:
  $ref: /openshift/<cluster>/cluster.yml

app:
  $ref: /services/unleash/app.yml

managedTerraformResources: true
```

Replace `<cluster>` with the directory to the cluster configuration.

**NOTE:** More settings will be included to this Namespace in the next
sections.

## Configuration Secret

The Unleash instance expects an OpenShift Secret in the Namespace containing
with the following data:

- `GH_CLIENT_ID`: The Github client ID, acquired from the OAuth application
  registration (see the [Github Configuration](#github-configuration) section
  for details).
- `GH_CLIENT_SECRET`: The Github client secret, acquired from the OAuth
  application registration (see the 
  [Github Configuration](#github-configuration) section for details).
- `GH_CALLBACK_URL`: The Unleash callback page -
  `https://<unleash-instance-domain>/api/auth/callback`
- `ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN`: The Bearer token to access the Unleash Admin API
  directly. We recommend using the bash command `uuidgen` to generate the
  token.
- `SESSION_SECRET`: The secret to secure the client session. We recommend
  using the bash command `uuidgen` to generate the secret.

Go to the Unleash
[Vault secret](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-sre/list/unleash/)
and create a secret called `<application-name>-config`.

Then add it to the `unleash` Namespace:

```yaml
openshiftResources:
...
- provider: vault-secret
  path: app-sre/unleash/<application-name>-config
  version: 1
```

## Client Access Token Secret

The Client Access Token is also required by the Unleash instance, but it lives
in a different Secret so it can be exposed to the tenant's application
Namespace.

Only one key is expected in this Secret:

- `CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN`: The Bearer token to access the Unleash Client API
  directly. We recommend using the bash command `uuidgen` to generate the
  token.

Go to the Unleash
[Vault secret](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/app-sre/list/unleash/)
and create a secret called `<application-name>-unleash-token`.

Then add it to the `unleash` Namespace:

```yaml
openshiftResources:
...
- provider: vault-secret
  path: app-sre/unleash/<application-name>-unleash-token
  version: 1
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure to add the `vault-secret` resource also to the
Namespace of the application consuming the Unleash instance (tenants are
expected to inform the application Namespace in the JIRA ticket).

## Database

Each instance of Unleash requires an independent PostgreSQL Database. To create
one, add this section to the Unleash Namespace:

```yaml
terraformResources:
...
- provider: rds
  account: <aws-account>
  identifier: <unique-rds-identifier>
  defaults: /terraform/resources/unleash/rds-1.yml
  output_resource_name: <application-name>-unleash-rds
```

## Route

Expose the Unleash instance with an OpenShift Route and add the `route`
resource to the `unleash` Namespace:

```yaml
openshiftResources:
...
- provider: route
  path: /<cluster>/unleash/<application-name>.route.yaml
```

The `host` value of the `Route` spec shall be
`<application-name>.unleash.devshift.net`. You have to arrange to get that
sub-domain created.
[Example](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/blob/master/resources/app-sre/unleash/app-interface.route.yaml).

## Deployment

To deploy the new instance to the `unleash` Namespace, add a target to the
`resourceTemplates` section in the
[Unleash SaaS file](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/blob/master/data/services/unleash/cicd/saas.yaml):

```yaml
resourceTemplates:
- name: unleash
  url: https://github.com/app-sre/unleash
  path: /openshift/unleash.yaml
  targets:
  ...
  ...
  - namespace:
      $ref: /services/unleash/namespaces/<application-name>-unleash.yml
    ref: <commit-hash>
    parameters:
      identifier: <application-name>
      configSecret: <application-name>-config
      databaseSecret: <application-name>-unleash-rds
      tokenSecret: <application-name>-unleash-token
      org: <github-org>
      team: <github-team>

```

That will create the Unleash Deployment and Service in the Namespace using the
Unleash version pin-pointed by the `<commit-hash>`.

Parameters:
- `identifier`: The application name, used to name the Deployment and the
  Service.
- `configSecret`: The configuration secret name as defined in the
  [Configuration Secret](#configuration-secret) section.
- `databaseSecret`: The `output_resource_name` as defined in the
  [Database](#database) section.
- `tokenSecret`: The token secret name as defined in the
  [Client Access Token Secret](#client-access-token-secret) section.
- `org`: The Github Organization that the Web UI users have to be member of in
  order to access this Unleash instance, as defined in the
  [Github Org/Team](#github-org/Team) section.
- `team`: The Github Team that the Web UI users have to be member of in order
  to access this Unleash instance, as defined in the
  [Github Org/Team](#github-org/Team) section.

Namespace.

The Web UI / REST API endpoint is:
https://<application>.unleash.devshift.net/
