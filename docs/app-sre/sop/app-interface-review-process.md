# App Interface review process

This is a WIP SOP intended for use by App SRE team members acting as Interrupt Catcher or just reviewing merge requests to app-interface.

## Process

1. Verify that build passes.
2. Verify that the `app-interface JSON validation` report is as expected due to the changes introduced in the MR.
3. Check specific review instructions (see #specific-review-instructions)
4. If any additional reviewers are required, ping them on the MR (see #additional-reviewers).
5. Once the MR looks good to you, add the `lgtm` label or comment `/label lgtm`. The MR will be merged automatically within minutes.

## Notes

* Some merge requests will be created with an `automerge` label. No need to review or merge those.
