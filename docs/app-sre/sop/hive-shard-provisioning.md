# Info

**Aim of this doc:** This SOP serves as a step-by-step process on how to provision a new Hive shard from zero (no cluster) to a fully functioning hive shard used by OCM

**Feeds into Goal:** Scale out OSD + Managed Services control plane to meet increasing business demand for capacity, reduce risk and scale.

**Definition of Done:** This initiative has met its delivery target when
- We have 4 hive clusters, entirely managed via a single consistent pipeline
- We have de-provisioned the OSD-3 based old-hive-prod
- We have proven, documented and monitor for all hive cluster hosted components and their engagement with upstream services

# Process

## Provisioning the cluster

1. Follow the standard [Cluster Onboarding SOP](app-interface-onboard-cluster.md) using the following specs

    |                    | Staging     | Production |
    |--------------------|-------------|------------|
    | Availability       | Single zone | Multizone  |
    | Compute type       | m5.xlarge   | m5.xlarge  |
    | Compute count      | 4           | 9          |
    | Persistent storage | 600 GB      | 600 GB     |
    | Load balancers     | 0           | 0          |
    | Machine CIRD       | See note    | See note   |
    | Privacy            | Private     | Private    |

1. Configure VPC peering
1. Add automationToken to `cluster.yml` (required for non-OCM group management)
1. Add hive-readers and hive-admins in `cluster.yml`
1. Assign hive permissions in

    | Role file                            | Staging                                 | Production                               |
    |--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
    | data/teams/hive/roles/dev.yml        | hive-admins<br>View access to namespace | hive-readers<br>View access to namespace |
    | data/teams/hive/roles/qe.yml         | hive-admins                             | hive-readers                             |
    | data/teams/sd-uhc/roles/dev.yml      | hive-readers                            | hive-readers                             |
    | data/teams/app-sre/roles/app-sre.yml | hive-admins                             | hive-admins                              |

1. Add `ClusterRoleBinding` (required?)

   - Example: https://issues.redhat.com/projects/OHSS/issues/OHSS-495

## Provisioning Hive

Provisioning hive is a multi-step process:
- Add the hive namespace:
- Add the hive operator saas job:
- Add the hiveconfig CR saas job:

## Hive Monitoring

1. Add scrapeconfigs here: [/resources/observability/prometheus/prometheus-app-sre-additional-scrapeconfig.secret.yaml]()
1. Add datasource here: [/resources/observability/grafana/grafana-datasources.secret.yaml]()

    **Example MR:** [https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/6455]()

1. Add the prometheus rules for hive

    - Duplicate [/resources/observability/prometheusrules/hive-production.prometheusrules.yaml]()
    - Add to [/data/services/observability/namespaces/openshift-customer-monitoring.app-sre-prod-01.yml]()

## Provisioning OSD operators

### Resources

#### operator resources (secrets, configmaps, etc)

Add a new directory named after the shard name here: [/data/services/osd-operators/namespaces]()

It is typical to copy the content from another shard of the same environment as we are re-using the same configs and secrets for all shards.

#### saas deploy jobs

OSD operator are deployed using saas-file. In order to deploy to a new shard, a new target must be added to all of the OSD operators saas files located here: [/data/services/osd-operators/cicd/saas]()

### OSD operators notes

#### aws-account-operator

- (SREP) AWS account pool creation: this takes some time because AWS has to enable enterprise support before accounts can be used

1. Summary

    The steps above should be executed to enable the aws-account-operator in a new shard. Please execute them and perform the validation on the last step before the shard goes live. The suggestion is for those steps to be executed by app-sre folks with someone from v1alpha1 shadowing. To start the process, please create a card in OSD board and assign it to v1alpha1 requesting support from someone from v1alpha1 + desired timeframe.

2. Confirm the total number of used accounts

    Make sure there are at least 300 accounts left in the payer account. To check it, run the command above from the payer account and compare it against the account limit per payer account. The account limit is 5000 in production, and the shared stage/integration limit has been increased to 7500 by AWS.

    ```
    $ aws organizations list-accounts | jq '.Accounts[].Name' | wc -l
    ```

3. Make sure the operator is up and running in the new shard

    Check operator logs and confirm there are no errors

    ```
    $ oc get pods -n aws-account-operator
    ```

4. Deploy an AccountPool CR in the new hive shard

    Apply to the new shard an [AccountPool CR](https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/blob/master/deploy/crds/aws_v1alpha1_accountpool_cr.yaml) with PoolSize = 50

    [Card to automate this step](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSD-4602)

5. Apply AWSFederatedRoles

    Apply all AWSFederatedRoles from the [deploy/crds](https://github.com/openshift/aws-account-operator/tree/master/deploy/crds) folder, using:

    ```
    $ osdctl federatedrole apply -f aws_v1alpha1_awsfederatedrole_networkmgmt_cr.yaml
    $ osdctl federatedrole apply -f aws_v1alpha1_awsfederatedrole_readonly_cr.yaml
    ```

    [Card to automate this step](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/OSD-4603)

6. Validate - Confirm accounts have been created to fill the Pool

    Check the account CRs in the new shard have been created, initialized and have EnterpriseSupport on, by checking the account CRs. Account creation and initialization takes around 1min/account, so initializing the initial pool of 50 accounts will take close to 1hour. After this period youâ€™ll notice the account CRs will be moved to the PendingVerification status:

    ```
    $ oc get accounts -n aws-account-operator
    osd-creds-mgmt-wqdf9f   PendingVerification                                 13m
    osd-creds-mgmt-wsszvm   PendingVerification                                 14m
    osd-creds-mgmt-wzwpd9   PendingVerification                                14m
    osd-creds-mgmt-x78rz9   PendingVerification                                13m
    osd-creds-mgmt-x7jh4m   PendingVerification                                13m
    osd-creds-mgmt-xvt6h9   PendingVerification                                13m
    osd-creds-mgmt-zmrdht   PendingVerification                                 11m
    osd-creds-mgmt-zrfxh6   PendingVerification                                 11m
    osd-creds-mgmt-zz8tzf   PendingVerification                                 13m
    osd-creds-mgmt-zzfz9j   PendingVerification                                 10m
    ```

    In the **PendingVerification** status, the account is pending on action from AWS, processing a SupportCase the operator creates automatically to request EnterpriseSupport to be turned on. It's a manual operation performed in Amazon, so the time it takes can vary (from 30 minutes to 4 hours).

    When adding a production shard we should wait for all the accounts to be initialized and processed by AWS before turning on scheduling clusters to it.

#### certman-operator

We are re-using the same ConfigMap across all shards

We are re-using the same Secrets across all shards

#### cloud-ingress-operator

Ensure that the new hive shard's egress gateway IP is listed in [/data/services/osd-operators/cicd/saas/saas-cloud-ingress-operator.yaml]()

#### deadmanssnitch-operator

We are re-using the same secrets (same API key) across all shards

#### gcp-project-operator

We are re-using the same secrets (gcp^credentials) across all shards

#### pagerduty-operator

It is known and acknowledged that we are starting with using the same key for the different shards, so there is no extra steps needed for pagerduty-operator once namespaces/CR are deployed through app-interface.

#### splunk-forwarder-operator

We are re-using the same secrets across all shards

### Others

#### SelectorSyncSets

Deploy SelectorSyncSets to new hive cluster

Example MR: [https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests /6823]()

#### ClusterImageSets

To deploy ClusterImageSets to a new cluster, add a target in the matching saas file: [/data/services/osd-operators/cicd/saas/clusterimagesets]()

#### Managed-tenants

To deploy the managed-tenants SelectorSyncSets, add a target in the managed-tenants saas file: [/data/services/app-sre/cicd/ci-int/saas-managed-tenants.yaml]()

## Validations

- Consult SDA QE for a full stack test
- Test provisioning an AWS cluster
- Test provisioning a GCP cluster
- Test that private clusters can be provisioned
  - Can SRE-P access them?
  - Does Hive report them as Reachable?
- Make sure certificates are delivered quickly (currently within 10 minutes of Ready in OCM)
- Verify that all syncsetinstances report Applied == true. Currently the managed-velero sss takes a while, but after some minutes, all should report successfully applied.
- Verify that at least one round of osde2e tests ran successfully when using the new shard. Dashboards:
  - [https://prow.ci.openshift.org/job-history/gs/origin-ci-test/logs/osde2e-prod-aws-e2e-default]()
  - [https://openshift.github.io/osde2e/]()

## Adding the shard to OCM

1. Add uhc-leadership namespace. Example: [https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/6829]()
1. Add Service Account references to hive, aws-account-opeator and gcp-project-operator namespaces from the uhc namespaces. Example:
[https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/7655]()1. Update uhc-clusters-service secret to add new shards. Example:
[https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/7665]()
1. The id field is set to a random uuid unique per shard (uuidgen can be used to generate one)
