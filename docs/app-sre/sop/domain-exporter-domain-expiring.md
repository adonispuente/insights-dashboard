# Domain expiring in less than XX days

In general domains at Red Hat are managed by Red Hat Legal team, in case that we got an alert for any domain near expiration we should make sure that the tenant has contacted the legal team and that they are already acting on the case if the domain is not on auto-renew to solve the situation before a real problem appear.

More information about domains can be found [here](https://source.redhat.com/departments/legal/redhatintellectualproperty/intellectual_property_and_ip_litigation_wiki/domain_names)

And in case that we need to contact Red Hat legal for any domain issue the contact would be `domainadmin@redhat.com` or `ebritton@redhat.com`
