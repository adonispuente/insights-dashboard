# 1. Description

This SOP describes how to request a new (or the renewal of a) TLS certificate signed externally by DigiCert.

The IT Operations team is responsible for TLS certificates.

Their IRC channel at irc.devel.redhat.com is #iso (on-call can be pinged for urgent requests)

# 2. Process

1. Generate a CSR/KEY (if a new certificate is requested)
2. Open a ticket with IT Operations at https://redhat.service-now.com/help

    - New request
    - Information Technology
    - General Service Request
    - Subject: (New|Renew) DigiCert certificate for <FQDN> (*.<FQDN> if a wildcard is needed)
    - Attach CSR to the request if a new certificate is requested
3. The certificate will be attached to the ticket once it is created. Optionally you can request that you want the certificate to be sent via email.
4. (Optionally) If the certificate is to be used for an OpenShift route, it should be added to vault along with the corresponding key
    
    Ex:
        
        >Â app-interface/app-sre/routes/try.openshift.com
            caCertificate: <cacert>
            certificate: <crt>
            key: <key>
