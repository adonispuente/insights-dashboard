# saas-auto-promotions-manager (SAPM)

SAPM is currently only running in test mode, i.e., it does not do any real changes.

If there are any issues with SAPM, please do not bother! For now, just turn it off and ping @kfischer.

## Turning off SAPM

### Via unleash feature flag

The easiest way is to disable the [unleash feature flag](https://app-interface.unleash.devshift.net/projects/default/features/saas-auto-promotions-manager).

### Remove integration from app-interface

Worst-case you can also remove the integration in full from app-interface if the unleash feature flag doesnt work for you.
