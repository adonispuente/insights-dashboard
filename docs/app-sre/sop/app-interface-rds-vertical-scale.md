# Vertical scaling of RDS instances via app-interface

## Background

From time to time we will need to vertically scale an RDS instance.

A vertical scale is the approach to increase the capacity of a single instance, for example by adding more processing power or storage.

## Purpose

This document explains how to vertically scale an RDS instance managed through app-interface.

## Process

1. Find the RDS instance you want to scale in the appropriate namespace file.
    * Example - RDS instance defition: [uhc-production/cluster-service](/data/services/uhc/namespaces/uhc-production.yml#L56)
2. Take a snapshot of the RDS instance
    * Find the actual RDS instance in AWS [RDS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=us-east-1#databases:)
    * Select the instance and select `Actions` -> `Take snapshot`.
    * The snapshot name should be of the form `<instance-identifier>-<YYYYMMDDHHmmZzzz>`.  Z000 = UTC, Z700 = UTC+7, etc.
        * Example: `clusters-service-production-201906241126Z000`.
3. Add an `overrides` section if one does not exist. Each attribute in this section will override the defaults in the file specified in the `defaults` section.
    * Example - defaults file: [app-sre/production/rds defaults](/resources/terraform/resources/app-sre/production/rds-1.yml)
4. To vertically scale, you can change one of the following attributes under `overrides`:
    * `instance_class` - select a supported instance class.
    > Note: instance class selection is limited in [app-interface schema](/schemas/openshift/namespace-1.yml#L193).
    * `allocated_storage` - increase allocated storage for the instance.
5. Create a Merge Request to app-interface with these changes.
6. Verify in the `terraform-resources` integration output that the change that is about to happen is of type `update` and not `replace`.
7. A modification (but not maintenance) event will be present for a class change. This change will incur some downtime, which varies by the size and load of the database. To trigger the change, use the aws cli as such:  
```
aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier="uhc-acct-mngr-integration" --apply-immediately
```  
This will then put the database into a modifying state and bring it back on-line with the new class.
