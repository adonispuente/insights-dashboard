## Introduction to the SD Incident Management Process

AppSRE follows the official [Service Delivery Incident Management Process](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/service-delivery/service_delivery_wiki/incident_management_process).

All AppSRE team members must read this process.

## Major Incident Definition Criteria

The Major Incident process is only applicable to services that are used by customers: internal or external. Internal tooling is excluded.

A Major Incident is defined as such if any of the following statements apply:

* Full outage or heavy degradation of one or multiple services impacting one or several customers.
* Duration of the incident is greater than 4 hours.
* Multiple layers and SRE teams are impacted (platform, application, ...).

## Incident Roles in the AppSRE team

* **First Responder**: Oncall engineer, by default FTS, Primary or Secondary, in that order. Their role in the incident will be defined in the first moments of it from the roles below.
* **Incident Commander**: In charge of communications, fallout and ensuring continuity of the incident investigation. Usually the team manager. Outside of working hours, this role defaults to **First Responder**.
* **Incident Tech Lead**: In charge of the technical resolution of the incident: investigation, mitigation and resolution. Defaults to **First Responder**. The **Incident Commander** may assign this role to a different person.
* **Parallel Investigator**: An additional engineer that will support the **Incident Tech Lead** to assist with the issue investigation, mitigation and resolution. Nominated by the **Incident Commander**.
* **Incident Owner**: Responsible for the incident after it has been resolved, being responsible for RCA and agreeing follow-up actions with all stakeholders. Defaults to **First Responder**. Can be changed by the team manager or team lead, but requires explicit acknowledgement of the change.

## Incident Commander Responsibilities

As soon as the **Incident Commander** is nominated, which should be 10 minutes after the start of the incident, and which defaults to the **First Responder** in the event that no other AppSRE engineers are available, they must carry out these tasks:

### Incident Management

* Nominate any additional Parallel Investigators.
* Ensure there is an incident continuity plan, so the incident continues to be investigated after the current shift ends.
* Request help from relevant SMEs, usually from other teams.
* Escalate to managers.
* Ensure the incident is actively being investigated, mitigated and resolved.

### Immediate Communication - Non-Security Incident

* Create a JIRA with type `Task`, with label `type/incident` in the [APPSRE board].
* Create slack channel for the incident, referencing the JIRA and the bridge ([zti]).
* Start the RCA, by creating a copy of the [RCA template]. Attach to the JIRA.
* Post a message to #sd-incidents-announce with: Service Name, short description of the issue, impact, JIRA and link to bridge ([zti]).
* Send email to [serviceOwners], [serviceNotifications],
  [sd-org@redhat.com](mailto:sd-org@redhat.com) and to
  [sd-notifications@redhat.com](mailto:sd-notifications@redhat.com). The email
  should include: Service Name, short description of the issue, impact and JIRA.

### Immediate Communication - Security Incident
* Create a JIRA with type `Task`, with label `type/incident` in the [APPSRE board] and make sure to set the Security Level to `Red Hat Employee (Red Hat Employee and Contractors only)`.
* Use [sd-app-sre-teamchat](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#chat/space/AAAAQNx6VpQ) Google Chat to triage, i.e create a specific Google Space for the incident.
* Send an email to [InfoSec team](mailto:infosec@redhat.com) and sd-sre-security@redhat.com explaining the situation. This will automatically creates a SNOW ticket.
Please note that all security-related discussion should not be happening on Slack.

### Continuous Communication (every 30 minutes)
This section needs to be carried out every 30 minutes, while the service is
degraded.

* [Updating status.redhat.com] if relevant.
* [Updating status.quay.io] if relevant.
* Update #sd-incidents-announce channel with current state of the incident, including impact.
* Send update to the email thread created in the first step.

### Resolution

Upon resolution, all the surfaces that were used to report the incident should be notified:

* Incident slack channel.
* #sd-incidents-announce slack channel.
* Email thread created in the first step.

## AppSRE Internal Escalations

### During working hours

The **First Responder** may ask other AppSRE team members to join with the incident effort. The **Incident Tech Lead** role will default to the **First Responder**, unless otherwise explicitely stated during the initial moments of the incident. At least one more person will be involved which will be made the **Incident Commander** (usually team manager). Depending on the severity of the issue, other people may join to act as a **Parallel Investigator**.

The team manager and the team lead must be notified of these incidents.

### Outside of working hours

The **First Responder**, acting as the **Incident Tech Lead**, will also become the **Incident Commander**. They try to resolve the incident by themselves. If assistance is needed due to the complexity or criticality of the issue, theymay escalate to the **Secondary On-Call**, or to the team manager (create issue in PD and assign to them).

Note: currently there is no on-call rotation for team managers. This will be created in the future.

## External Escalations

### Service Development Team

**During Business Hours**

The incident should be escalated to the Service development team within 30 minutes.

**Outside of Business Hours**

The incident should be escalated to the Service development team within 1 hour, or sooner if the AppSRE engineer considers the SOPs have been exhausted.

In order to escalate to the developer oncall, the escalation policy must have been provided and documented in
App-Interface in the `escalationPolicy` field of the corresponding `app-1.yml` file.

If there is no `escalationPolicy`, the incident should be escalated to the team manager.

### SREP Team - OSD infrastructure

If there is any indication that the incident may have been caused by an OSD infrastructure issue, the incident must be escalated oncall SREP team immediately, by pinging `@sre-platform-primary` in the `#sd-sre-platform` channel, or by creating a PD incident and assigning to them.

## Specific AppSRE Flow

1. Initial Response:
  * AppSRE engineer on call (FTS, Primary, Secondary) becomes the **First Responder**.
  * Continue debugging the issue.
2. 10 minutes later:
  * Nominate **Incident Commander** (usually team manager - or **First Responder** if outside of working hours).
  * Join the AppSRE bridge [zti].
  * Continue debugging the issue.

## Technical Incident Checklist

The **Incident Tech Lead** (defaults to **First Responder**) and **Parellel Investigator(s)** are responsible for the investigation, mitigation and resolution of the incident.

The goal of this section is to propose some actions, and to list some resources, that may help with the resolution of the incident.

### Collect Information

* Log into the cluster with the `oc` cli tool, and then run the [must-gather] script to collect data.
* Access the AppSRE grafana and look for the relevant [dashboard](https://grafana.app-sre.devshift.net/dashboards).
* Fetch pod logs with `oc logs`. If you need older data, it can be accessed via CloudWatch, following the [Log Forwarding] FAQ.

### Service Documention and SOPs

* Find the service in [Visual App-Interface](https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net/services).
* `sopsUrl` field of the corresponding `app-1.yml` file. TODO: Add to Visual-App-Interface.
* `architectureDocument` field in the `app-1.yml` file.
* Many services have placed their SOPs in the [App-Interface docs] folder.
* Onboarding questionnaire for the service. This can be found referenced by an [Onboarding Epic].

### Common Causes

This section aims to give some ideas of possible generic underlying causes.

* Recent configuration changes and/or deployments. This implies checking the service `saas-file` and the relevant `namespace` file in App-Interface. If this is the case, a rollback should be evaluated.
* Check the latest deployment job to find any discrepancies or errors.
* Killing the pods (if the service is stateless), may fix the issue or help uncover the root cause.
* Many issues are related to lack of resources. OOMKills are usually a tell-tale sign of this. Increasing `requests` and `limits` in the OpenShift manifest via parameters in the `saas-file` could fix the issue. It is important to support that theory with data, usually obtained from Grafana.
* Underlying infrastructure issues should be ruled out. For example, if all crashing pods are in the same node. If this is the case it should be escalated to SREP.
* RDS should be ruled out as the cause. It is recommended to look at the database through the AWS Console. In particular: CPU and memory load, IOPS and burst quota. When in doubt, AWS Performance Insights can be enabled to obtain further data about the database, including long running issues. Note that rebooting the database is not recommended by default.
* In case the service is under load, consider adding more replicas to handle it. It is important to support that theory with data, usually obtained from Grafana.

## Post Mortem

Once the issue has been mitigated and resolved, the **Incident Owner** (defaults to **First Responder**) must carry out the following tasks:

* Understanding the course of the incident and its technical details from start to finish.
* Organizing and driving the PMR meeting in the 5 business days after recovery.
* Is accountable to ensure that full RCA documentation is written up and making sure it contains all the corrective actions. Impact, detection and mitigation should be documented within 24 hours of the incident.
* Being the main point of reference for the incident when there are follow-up questions about it.
* Driving any follow-up activity linked to the incident.
* Cleaning up after the incident is fully closed, like archiving the slack channel.

### Tracking action items

It is important to link any Jira tickets (use **is triggering**) that are created as action items for the incident to the AppSRE incident ticket. This makes it easier for AppSRE to track action items from incidents and follow-up on them as part of the checkpoint process.
