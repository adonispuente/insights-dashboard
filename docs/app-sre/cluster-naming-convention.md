# AppSRE Cluster Naming Standard

## Purpose
This document defines a naming scheme for all AppSRE clusters.

## Background
Although a cluster name can be up to 64 characters, only the first 15 are displayed in the URL (a consequence of this [issue](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/SDA-2288) ), which can cause confusion when accessing multiple clusters at one time. The idea is to create a name that is unique and human readable but only 15 chars.

## Conclusions
The cluster names must have a maximum of 15 characters and the following shape:

`<service>(p|s)NN<region abbreviation>`

### Notes
* When creating a new cluster, please check if a previous one has been created for the same service.
* `NN` is a counter per service, neither per environment nor per region.
* To keep the name to 15 chars, limit the service name to 8 chars or fewer. In other words, 8c1c2c4c. For example, `crcp01ue1` or `crcp01ase2`.
