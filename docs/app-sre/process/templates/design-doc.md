## Problem Statement
* What’s going on?
* Why is it important?
* Where is the problem?

## Goals
* Describe technically what is going to be delivered with this proposal
* If a metric/dashboard is provided as part of the goals, it’s even better

## Non-objectives
* Describe technically what it is not going to be delivered
* This is especially important to focus the conversations around the design doc

## Proposal
* Ideally, it should be detailed enough that somebody who already understands the problem could go out and code the project without having to make any significant decisions.
* The design doc should only include one proposal. If alternatives considered are worth mentioning, do it in the appropriate section.

## Alternatives considered
* Add this section only if there are alternatives and if they are relevant
  * Highlight why they were discarded in favor of the proposal

## Milestones
* List all the different steps that will take to get the proposal running in production
* This is not meant to replace any project plan, JIRA or whatever tool we use for planning, so don't commit to any particular date. These are technical milestones.
