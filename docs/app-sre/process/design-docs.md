# Design doc process

## Date
Oct,4 2021

## Objectives of the design doc process
* Create a tool to build solutions collaboratively and asynchronously for app-sre team
* Fill some of our documentation gaps
  * Create point in time feature documentation that helps understand development by providing context and technical specifications.
  * Sharing context and knowledge around main developments
* Ensure design choices are taken and signed off in a timely manner

## Non-objectives
* Design docs won't be updated
* Design docs are not meant to replace app-sre internal technical documentation.

## Design doc process
### Trigger
There is no deterministic way to decide if a given Jira card will require a design doc. This will be part of the [grooming process](backlog_management.md). If the grooming group states a ticket requires a design doc, it will be added to the Acceptance Criteria for the ticket.
### Building the design doc
When a team member picks up a ticket with a design doc AC, they become responsible for the design doc itself. The design doc structure will be described in a later section.
Writing the design doc is not necessarily an individual effort, the ticket owner is free to share it, discuss it with other team members before submitting it for the team's review.

_Note: while writing this document, it might be helpful to start writing some code or prototyping. However, as long as the design doc has not been reviewed and accepted, all of this might have to be discarded!_

Once ready, the ticket owner will submit the document for review to the team by using the sd-app-sre mail list. (ticket owner is free to announce it in other channels as well)
### Reviews
As a general rule, the approval process should not last more than 5 working days from the submission date.
Once submitted, every team member is encouraged to review the design doc, provide feedback and a `lgtm` if approved.. Those reviews are happening asynchronously.
Ticket owner is responsible for getting these reviews and processing the comments, either incorporating them in the doc or addressing them in the dedicated comment thread.

At the end of the approval period, we should be in one of the 2 following situations:
* There is a general consensus on the proposal, comments have been incorporated, questions answered and no red flag remains. In that case, the ticket owner will confirm the approval of the design doc by sending a mail to sd-app-sre.
* No consensus emerges (too many comments, a new proposal emerges, red flags, etc.). In that case, the ticket owner takes back the design doc to rework it (by sending a mail to sd-app-sre). They might engage further with reviewers to work on another proposal. If some facilitation is needed, managers can be involved and the technical lead will have a quality vote to unblock disagreements.

### Acceptance
Once approved, the team de facto commits to the proposed design and implementation can start.

Design doc will be persisted (more details in the dedicated section)

## Design doc structure
Find the template [here](templates/design-doc.md)

## Design doc persistence
The design doc proposals and discussions will be done as pull requests in the [app-interface](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master/docs/app-sre) repository, under [`docs/app-sre/design-docs`](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master/docs/app-sre/design-docs) directory.

This is based on the following premises:

* Design docs need to be persisted in a read-only manner to ensure they wonâ€™t be modified once approved.
* Design docs may contain sensitive information which may prevent them to be public
* Design docs should be easy to find so they should be in a central location.
* Design docs discussions should be available for future reference.
