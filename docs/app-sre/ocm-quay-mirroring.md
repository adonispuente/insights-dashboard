# OCM Quay mirroring

## Background

This is a document describing how mirroring is done into ocm-quay, along with some additional required information

## How does mirroring work?

Mirroring of images to ocm-quay is done by an integration called `quay-mirror-org`: https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-reconcile/blob/master/reconcile/quay_mirror_org.py

This integration mirrors entire Quay organizations.

The mirrored orgs can be found here: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master/data/dependencies/ocm-quay

Note: For an org to be mirrored, it's repositories have to be managed via app-interface.

## Mirroring of OpenShift release images

The images from the `openshift-release-dev` org are mirrored by an integration called `ocp-release-mirror`: https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-reconcile/blob/master/reconcile/ocp_release_mirror.py

This integration mirrors the two repositories of this organization: `ocp-release` and `ocp-v4.0-art-dev`.

This integration takes it's configuration from: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/app-interface/ocp-release-mirror-1.yml

## OpenShift Dedicated fallback on ocm-quay

ocm-quay is used as a fallback for OSD installations if quay.io is down.

This ConfigMap is the place to define it: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/resources/services/ocm/clusters-service.configmap.yaml

This file contains the default OpenShift installer configuration. It will be read when a new cluster is created, and merged with the configuration dynamically generated by the service.
