## AppSRE Engineer Onboarding

### Laptop security

You have a new, shiny laptop. Now, make sure you comply with [the laptop security guidelines](https://source.redhat.com/departments/it/it-information-security/wiki/laptop_security).

### Declare your GitHub repositories in Rover

Ideally, you'd declare your **professional** social media in your
[Rover profile](https://rover.redhat.com/people/profile/). At the very
least, we want you to declare your GitHub account there so that
InfoSec can [scan for any key
leaks](https://source.redhat.com/departments/it/it-information-security/wiki/details_about_rover_github_information_security_and_scanning#how-can-i-tell-the-scanner-to-allow-certain-things-in-my-repo-)
on your **public** repositories.

### Registering the user in App-Interface

Most of the resources required as an AppSRE will be obtained via a user definition with AppSRE-specific roles in App-Interface.

* Developer's guide: [How to add a user to
  App-Interface](https://service.pages.redhat.com/dev-guidelines/docs/appsre/onboarding/team/).
  [How to add
  roles](https://service.pages.redhat.com/dev-guidelines/docs/appsre/onboarding/roles/).
* AppSRE engineers are located here:
  https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master/data/teams/app-sre/users.
* [Generic documentation on how to add a
  user](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master/#add-or-modify-a-user-accessusers-1yml).
* Make sure your user file includes the `public_gpg_key` field.
  [Instructions](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master#adding-your-public-gpg-key).

* CLI installs
  * Ansible
    * You can install it directly on your local machine or in a virtual environment (recommended)
      * To install locally:
        * (MacOS) `brew install ansible`
        * (Fedora/RHEL) `dnf install ansible-core`
      * To install in a virtual environment:
        * Set up pyenv
        * Activate the virtual environment and install Ansible with `pip install ansible`
        * For this setup, I currently have `python version 3.9.12`, `ansible version 2.9.27`, `jinja2 version 3.0.3`, and `hvac version 0.10.0`
          * NOTE: The versions are very finicky, so it may take some trial and error
    * Ensure you have your SSH hosts file configured correctly because the ansible-playbook command assumes you do otherwise, it will throw an SSH error
  * Terraform
    * To install, go to the [vendor's download site](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/) to find the version you need.
    * Ensure you have the correct terraform version on your laptop by looking at what [cli.py shows in qontract-reconcile for environment variable TERRAFORM_VERSION](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-reconcile/blob/master/reconcile/cli.py)
  * AWS
    * Following the installation steps [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
    * Since enforcing MFA, you will need to follow [these steps](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/authenticate-mfa-cli/) in order to use the CLI.
      * Please note that this will only work for virtual devices.
  * Python
    * (MacOS) To install: `brew install python`
    * (Fedora/RHEL) should be pre-installed
    * Because we now require MFA, in order to login, you will have to do the following:
  * Alternatively, use pyenv to manage your versions of Python
    * (MacOS) To install: `brew install pyenv`
    * (Fedora/RHEL) Check out [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer)
  * OpenShift Client (oc)
    * Check out [this download page](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290) or, alternatively [this mirror](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/).
    * Instructions for installing are [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html).
    * qontract-reconcile uses a specific version of the oc binary [referenced in cli.py](https://github.com/app-sre/qontract-reconcile/blob/master/reconcile/cli.py#L136)

Every AppSRE engineer should have access to the following:

* GitHub
  * GitHub profile must include `Company: Red Hat`.

  * Make sure you enable MFA in **all** your AWS accounts.
* AppSRE infrastructure managed by Ansible
  * Access is managed by adding SSH keys to the [admin-list](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/app-sre/infra/blob/master/ansible/hosts/group_vars/all#L4) and applying the `baseline` role to all hosts. It is recommended that SSH key is RSA, 4096-sized and password-protected, as those are the [requirements for Tier 1 Bastion keys](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/openshiftplatformsre/wiki/faq_openshift_tiered_access_overview_for_osd3#jive_content_id_Tier_1)
* OpenStack Project infrastructure

  * Required permissions at the time of writing are:
    * Analyst
    * Guide Publisher
    * Guide Creator
    * Guide Content Editor
    * Viewer
* Unleash:
  * Feature toggle service to enable/disable features in runtime.

#### Returning Red Hat Employee Gotchas

* Accounts need to be re-enabled
  * Bugzilla
    * Send e-mail to bugzilla-owner@redhat.com or create a ticket at the [Help Portal](https://help.redhat.com/)
    * It is likely the re-activated account will not have the needed
      permissions. Request access to the devel group by following the directions
      [here](https://docs.engineering.redhat.com/display/OMEGA/Group+Membership+Policy)
  * BlueJeans
    * Create an IT ticket

#### Maintaining access pieces

Access pieces are a very quickly moving target, and they change very frequently. In order to maintain an accurate list of access pieces, these actions must be followed by each AppSRE team member:

* All access pieces are documented in the [Access and surfaces list](#access-and-surfaces-list) section.
* If an AppSRE team member gains access to something and it's not linked from in this list, it's their responsibility to add it there.
* This list is actively reviewed by onboarding AppSRE members.

### Knowledge Sharing and Training

This section documents the specific processes related to knowledge sharing by
the AppSRE team in order to maintain a high level of accuracy and coverage of
all the knowledge within AppSRE.

#### Introduction

The purpose of this section is to document how knowledge is shared by the
AppSRE, both internally and externally.

Before diving into specific processes, it is important to state that the team
has a very clear mission with regard to knowledge sharing:

* There are no single owners or SMEs for any of the components and processes
  owned or implemented by the AppSRE team.
* It is the responsibility of every AppSRE member to make sure no knowledge is
  in a silo and to share any new knowledge piece with the rest of the team using
  the implemented processes and channels.
* Each AppSRE member has the right to raise any concerns about any knowledge
  gaps, and the team will prioritize filling in those gaps.

#### Training Resources

The AppSRE team will maintain an index of training resources. All AppSRE members must go through [those training documents](https://source.redhat.com/groups/public/sre-services/sre_services_wiki/appsre_introduction#jive_content_id_AppSRE_Training).

#### Deep Dive sessions

On a periodical basis, the AppSRE team will hold "Deep Dive sessions". These sessions have the following characteristics:

* The main goal is to share knowledge within the AppSRE team.
* Periodicity: every 6 weeks.
* 1h sessions.
* Presentations should have an accompanying slide deck and must be well-prepared.
* Any topics that are directly related to the AppSRE day-to-day will be prioritized over general knowledge ones.
* Attendance from all the team members is strongly encouraged, as well as participation and making the session dynamic.

Those sessions are tracked in this document: [AppSRE Deep Dives](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T4QNO2qQYpBl4uhiNdr2iP7LO1pfmCVkzyWHgHDIIJA/edit).

Every AppSRE member that identifies any knowledge gaps in our documentation / resources has the responsibility of adding new proposals to the Deep Dives list of proposals.

#### Practical training Syllabus

Or: How to become a contributing AppSRE team member

This section guides a new team member in carrying out tasks that are:

- beneficial for the new team member
- beneficial for the team

As long as we can find tasks that match the learning criteria, we'll prefer to do them over doing an exercise task.

The assumption behind the structure of the syllabus is that there is a limited amount of information that is understood in every task, especially during the first period with the team. To have an experience in which the team member gets as much out of every task, we will want to make each task as narrow as possible. Following tasks will assume the knowledge from previous tasks and expand around it. This essentially means that we are doing more [DFS than BFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-bfs-and-dfs).

Since every project, small or large, goes through app-interface in some way, the first few tasks will focus on day-to-day activities in app-interface, such as CI/CD and integrations. With this knowledge gained very early in the on-boarding process of a new team member, many requests in #sd-app-sre will already be understandable.

A big part of being an SRE is to work through toil items. We want to encourage new team members to contribute to refactors, cleanups, and any other toil item. We want to encourage everyone to do that! chop wood, carry water.

Practical training is really a fancy name for working on tickets. Tickets to get started with are usually labelled as a `good-first-issue`, and some will contain an additional label `ai#n` to indicate the difficulty level:

[AI #1](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20APPSRE%20AND%20status%20%3D%20%22To%20Do%22%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20%22ai%231%22)
[AI #2](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20APPSRE%20AND%20status%20%3D%20%22To%20Do%22%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20%22ai%232%22)
[AI #3](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20APPSRE%20AND%20status%20%3D%20%22To%20Do%22%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20%22ai%233%22)
[AI #4](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20APPSRE%20AND%20status%20%3D%20%22To%20Do%22%20AND%20labels%20%3D%20%22ai%234%22)

Some of these tickets may be related to qontract-reconcile, which will require a [development environment setup](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/tree/master/docs/app-sre/sop/app-interface-development-environment-setup.md).

## On call

Documented in the [On Call rotation](./on-call.md) SOP.

## Incident Process

All AppSRE team members will follow the Incident Process as accurately as possible, raise any concerns and keep it up to date.

Documented in the [Incident Process](./incident-process.md) SOP.

## Contract

AppSRE establishes a contract with the tenants. The contract is live [here](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/app-sre/contract/-/blob/master/README.md).

All Services must satisfy the list of ACs (Acceptance Criteria): [acs.html](https://app-sre.pages.redhat.com/contract/acs.html) and [acs.txt](https://app-sre.pages.redhat.com/contract/acs.txt).

The process for Service Onboarding is documented [here](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/app-sre/contract/-/blob/master/content/service/service_onboarding_flow.md).

### SRE Checkpoints

All Services will receive an SRE Checkpoint periodically. Each SRE Checkpoint will take 1 day, and each AppSRE engineer will conduct one per sprint. [Further information](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/app-sre/contract/-/blob/master/content/process/sre_checkpoints.md).

## Maintenance Windows

Maintenance window activity guidance is documented [here](/docs/app-sre/maintenance-windows.md).
