## 1.2. Preface

This documents is for App-sre engineer consumption and aims to ensure agreement around and govern the App-sre continuity and readiness plan.
It serves as the top node and authorative source for documentation around App-sre process.

The document itself consists of two main sections, the first details prerequisites and process pieces that every App-sre engineer needs to have in place.  This serves as a checklist for access and details contact points on how to aquire any lacking access.

The second section consists of operational procedures and documentation that serves as references during incident work.

Information within this document aims to be he authorative source for process and (until further notice) contacts.  For details on the specifics of the operational environment the app-interface supercedes this document - hence this should be viewed as complementary and authorative only concerning process.  Content in this document should aim to reference the app-interface schemas as opposed to duplicating it, where possible.

Additionally there is a contact section near the end which details the escalations and contact for external groups and dependencies.
The goal is to move this to the app-interface itself as it matures.

## 1.3. Changes

- This document was created and maintained using vscode, using Markdown ToC plugin
- Merge requests are accepted but require team lead signoff
- As it is important to communicate and gain common aknowledgement of process captured within, this document will be reviewed every sprint retro when there are changes.  If you can not attend a sprint retro, make sure you review this document before going on call.
- Prior to each

# 2. Glossary

## PnT

Products & Technolgies, essentially Paul Cormierâs entire 7000 person org.

## PnT Ops

Product & Technologies Business Operations lead by VP Katrinka McCallum (non-technical team).  This is where all the Program Managers and metrics people hangout.

## PnT DevOps

Old Jay Ferrandini's team, made up of 5 pillars (SysOps, Labs, RCM, DevTools, AutomationQE).  This team handles hundreds of tools ranging from Jira & Bugzilla to platforms like CentralCI and UpShift. The SysOps pillar is most likely working on whatever is happening as they also maintain a huge pile of Jenkins boxes.  That team is lead by David Mair.
