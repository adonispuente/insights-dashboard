# App-SRE team Standard Operating Procedures

## AAA Document

The AAA document aims to become the
main process guide for team members.  It should be the app-sre main
source of truth for internal process and doubles as an on boarding
document.

Changes to this process should be submitted as merge requests to this
document with myself as a reviewer.  On the retro we will communicate
the proposed changes and, if discussion does not deem them
counter-productive, they are active as of when they are merged during
the retro.

### SOP directory

This directory contains runbooks that fit one of the following definitions:
- Linked directly from alerts for troubleshooting and resolution
- Specify a standard procedure for performing configuration changes

Please make sure that all SOP changes related to existing alerts are 
also reflected in the `runbook` field for its corresponding alerting rule
