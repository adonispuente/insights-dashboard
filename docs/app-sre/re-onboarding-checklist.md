# Re-Onboarding Checklist

An already onboarded service might undergo changes which require a new onboarding process to ensure our quality standards are met.
It is not straight forward to determine whether a change requires a new onboarding.
This document is a checklist to support the decision process.

## Criteria indicating requirement for a new Onboarding

If you see any of the following points apply to an MR, please share the MR with the rest of the team in slack indicating it might require a new onboarding.

### New API Endpoint

A new endpoint is an indicator for a substantial service change, especially if it is accessible to customers.
A new endpoint might be discoered by newly added Route objects.
Further, every endpoint should be part of the architecture document.
