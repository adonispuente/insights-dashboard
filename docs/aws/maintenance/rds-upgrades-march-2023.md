# RDS OS Upgrades - March 2023

[TOC]

Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL minor versions 14.2, 14.1, 13.6, 13.5, 13.4, 13.3, 12.10, 12.9, 12.8, 12.7, 11.15, 11.14, 11.13, 11.12, 10.20, 10.19, 10.18 and 10.17  will reach end of standard support on March 20, 2023. To prevent issues we ask the tenants to upgrade their RDS versions. The minimum supported versions by AppSRE are documented [here](/README.md#approved-rds-versions).

Minor version upgrades of database engines are typically backwards-compatible, but teams will need to perform their due diligence and test the impact of the upgrade on their services.

## How do I know if my RDS instances are affected?

[Click here](/README.md#approved-rds-versions) for a list of approved RDS database engine versions.

1. If you aren't running an approved minor version of your database engine, then your RDS instance is affected and will need database engine minor version upgrade.
2. If you are running an approved minor version, then your RDS instance is only affected if it has a [pending maintenance activity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.html#USER_UpgradeDBInstance.Maintenance.Viewing)

## What do I need to do if I have an affected RDS instance?

1. If your RDS instances are not running [approved versions](/README.md#approved-rds-versions), then you will need to [upgrade the database engine minor version in app-interface](/README.md#rds-minor-version-upgrades)
2. If you don't upgrade your RDS instance AWS will upgrade it automatically in the following RDS instance maintenance window:
   * **PostgreSQL**
     * Starting February 20, 2023 00:00:01 AM UTC, you will not be able to create new RDS instances with PostgreSQL minor versions listed above from either the AWS Console or the CLI. We recommend you to upgrade your databases before March 20, 2023. RDS will upgrade your PostgreSQL databases running minor versions listed above as well as any instances restored from the snapshots of these versions to the latest minor version during a scheduled maintenance window between March 20, 2023 00:00:01 UTC and April 20, 2023 00:00:01 UTC. On April 20, 2023 00:00:01 AM UTC, any PostgreSQL databases running minor versions listed above that remain will be upgraded to the latest minor version regardless of instancesâ€™ scheduled maintenance window.

## Will these upgrades cause a downtime?

Yes, you can expect a downtime for upgrades. They will occur during the maintenance window that you've configured for your RDS instance.

The downtime is associated with the database engine minor version upgrade, which you can read more about [here](/README.md#rds-minor-version-upgrades)

## Timeline

The timeline below summarizes the actions that need to be taken by each date.

| Deadline      | Tasks |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ASAP      | 1. Teams using RDS should check if their databases are running the versions outlined [here](/README.md#approved-rds-versions)<br>2. Start upgrading the minor versions of your affected databases in stage as soon as possible to provide sufficient time for testing       |
| March 20, 2022   | All stage and production databases should be running [approved versions of the database engine](/README.md#approved-rds-versions)       |
| April 20, 2023 00:00:01 AM | All RDS instances running PostgreSQL not supported minor versions will be upgraded to the latest minor version regardless of instances scheduled maintenance window    |
