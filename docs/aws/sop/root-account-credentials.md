# AWS root account password and two-factor authentication (2FA)

[TOC]

## Access required

### Vault aws-root-accounts engine

The access to the Vault aws-root-accounts engine where credentials are stored is operated in a break-glass way. In order to gain access to it:

* Make sure no other user has the `/teams/app-sre/roles/aws-root-accounts.yaml` associated to their user profile.
* Assign it to your user profile in app-interface.
* Log in Vault:
    ```
    vault login -method=oidc -address=https://vault.devshift.net
    ```

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure that the role `/teams/app-sre/roles/aws-root-accounts.yaml` is not assigned to you after you're done getting/setting root account credentials.

### AppSRE passwords collection in RedHat's BitWarden

**NOTE**: This is actually only needed if you need to set 2FA in an account.

* Log in BitWarden's Vault: https://vault.bitwarden.com/
* Make sure you can see the "AppSRE passwords" collection in RedHat's BitWarden.
* If not, you will need to ask in the AppSRE team for access to the "appsre-passwords" Rover collection: https://rover.redhat.com/groups/group/appsre-passwords

## Get root account password

Root password for an account `<account-name>` can be retrieved from Vault:

```
vault kv get aws-root-accounts/<account-name>
```

**NOTE**: Make sure you update the root account password once you're done using it (see below procedure).

## Get root account two factor authentication

### Vault

A 2FA code password for an account `<account-name>` can be retrieved from Vault:

```
vault read totp/aws-root-accounts/code/<account-name>
```

### BitWarden

You can get a 2FA from RedHat's BitWarden's Vault in the AppSRE collection. An entry should exist for the account you want to log in and you can get a code by right-clicking in the three dots in the corresponding UI line.

## Set root account password and 2FA

We'll use the password recovery mechanism for this. It is mandatory that you have access to the email associated to the account.

### Root account password

* Use the console url to log in.
* Click in the "Sign in using root user email" option.
* Try to log in with the root email and then click in the "Forgot Password?" link.
* An email will be sent to the email account and you can continue the process from there.
* Make sure that you generate a good password: 24 characters is a good starting point.
* Store the password in the [`aws-root-accounts`](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/aws-root-accounts/list) Vault engine.

### Two-factor authentication

* Use the console url to log in.
* Click in the "Sign in using root user email" option.
* Go to IAM section.
* In the IAM dashboard click in "My security credentials" quick link that you should see in the right part of the screen.

#### BitWarden 2FA

* Click in Assign MFA.
* Device name is `bitwarden-<account-name>`.
* Select Authenticator app MFA device type.
* Copy secret key shown in "Show secret key"
* Log into BitWarden https://vault.bitwarden.com/#/login.
* Create a new item under "Appsre Passwords" BitWarden collection called `AWS root <account-name> account`.
* Fill the "Authenticator key (TOTP)" with the secret key and save it.
* Add two consecutive verification codes in the AWS MFA page (you can get them by clicking in the three dots in BitWarden)

#### Vault 2FA

* Click in Assign MFA.
* Device name is `vault-<account-name>`.
* Select Authenticator app MFA device type.
* Read the QR Code with a QR Code reader app or extension. Android and iOS both have built-in QR code reader capabilities built into the Camera app.
* Write the OTP info to vault. The URL parameter value is what is encoded in the QR Code
    ```
    vault write totp/aws-root-accounts/keys/<account-name> url="<url-from-the-qr-code>"
    ```
  NOTE: The `url-from-the-qr-code` will look like: `otpauth://totp/some-provider-otp:some-user-id?secret=some-secret&issuer=some-issuer&period=30"`
* Read two consecutive verification codes and add them to AWS MFA page using the following command
    ```
    vault read totp/aws-root-accounts/code/<account-name>
    ```
### Verification

Don't forget to verify that you can log in with both 2FA settings.
