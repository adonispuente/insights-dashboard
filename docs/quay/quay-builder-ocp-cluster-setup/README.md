# Quay Builder OpenShift Cluster

Instructions to setup a OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster for Quay builders.

## Pre Requisites

### Red Hat Account

Request an account in APP SRE Red Hat organization if you don't have one. You will need it to get OpenShift installer and pull secrets.

### AWS Account

To get access to the AWS account dedicated for Quay builder cluster, you will need to be a member of the APP SRE team. Follow the steps documented [here](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface#add-or-modify-a-user-accessusers-1yml) to add a user to the team.

Once your request has been approved by APP SRE team, you will get an email with subject `Invitation to join the quay-builder AWS account`. Email will include AWS console url, your IAM username and password encrypted using your GPG key. You will be required to set a new password on first login.

### GitHub Team

Access to the OpenShift cluster is managed by GitHub [team](https://github.com/orgs/app-sre/teams/quay-app-sre). Make sure you are a member.

### Vault

Request and verify access to [quay secrets engine](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/quay/list) in Vault. Access to Vault is managed by app-interface. See [docs](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface#manage-vault-configurations-via-app-interface) for access.

### DNS Zone Delegation & Base Domain

If you are starting from scratch, you will need to create a DNS zone delegation in the AWS account. Current AWS account has hosted zone setup for the domain `ocp4-builder.quay.io`. This will be the base domain for the OCP cluster.

Base domain must be managed in the same AWS account where OpenShift cluster will be deployed. See [docs](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.html#installation-aws-route53_installing-aws-account) for more details.

### SSH Key

For production OpenShift Container Platform clusters on which you want to perform installation debugging or disaster recovery, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent` process uses to the installer. You can use this key to SSH into the master nodes as the user core. When you deploy the cluster, the key is added to the core userâ€™s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` list.

SSH key used for current cluster can be found in [Vault](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/quay/show/quay-builder/ssh-key).

Follow steps documented [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.html#ssh-agent-using_install-customizations-cloud) to add the SSH key to the `ssh-agent`.

## Install OCP Cluster on AWS

### AWS CLI Configuration

Install and configure AWS cli on the system where you will run the OpenShift installer. You may use the existing `terraform` user or [create an new one](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.html#installation-aws-iam-user_installing-aws-account).

### AWS Account/Region Limits

If you are using `us-east-1`, the default account limits are not enough to deploy OpenShift cluster even in a singe az mode. Review the limits listed [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-account.html#installation-aws-limits_installing-aws-account) and open support case with AWS to increase resource limits.

### Obtain Installer

Log into [OCM](https://cloud.redhat.com/) to download the OCP installer for AWS (with Installer-Provisioned Infrastructure) and pull secrets. You will also need the OpenShift command-line tools which can be downloaded from the same page.

### Installer Configuration File

Steps for creating the installer configuration file can be found [here](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.html#installation-initializing_install-customizations-cloud). A copy of the `install-config.yaml` used to setup the builder cluster can be found [here](ocp-installer-config/install-config.yaml). The installer configuration file is consumed with each install run so make sure to backup the configuration file before running the installer. This will allow you to re-run installer with same configuration if needed.

#### Cluster Configuration

| | Master | Worker | Bare-metal Worker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|**Count/Instance Type**|3 / m5.xlarge|3 / m5.xlarge | 1 / m5.metal|
|**EBS Volume Type**|gp2|gp2|gp2|
|**EBS Volume IOPS**|100|100|5000|
|**EBS Volume Size**|500|500|5000|
|**Region**|us-east-1|us-east-1|us-east-1|
|**Availability Zone**|us-east-1d|us-east-1d|us-east-1d|

When creating the cluster install config, you will configure it for `3` master nodes and `3` worker nodes of type m5.xlarge. `m5.metal` worker node will be added once the cluster setup is complete.

See [install-config.yaml](ocp-installer-config/install-config.yaml) for networking configuration details.

### Deploy the Cluster

Follow [instructions](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/installing/installing_aws/installing-aws-customizations.html#installation-launching-installer_install-customizations-cloud) to deploy the cluster.

Installer will take about 60 minutes to deploy the cluster if there are no issues.


## Configure OpenShift Cluster

To setup the cluster, you can use the temporary `kubeadmin` credentials.

Note: You must update files with actual values before running commands listed below.

### Create Security Context Constraints

```sh
oc apply -f cluster-setup/01-quay-builder-scc.yaml
```

### Configure GitHub Identity Provider

[Register](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-github-identity-provider.html#identity-provider-registering-github_configuring-github-identity-provider) a new GitHub application in the `app-sre` organization.

#### Create the Secret

```sh
oc create secret generic -n openshift-config github-secret --from-literal=clientSecret=<redacted>
```

#### Create OAuth CR

```sh
oc apply -f cluster-setup/02-github-idp-oauth.yaml
```

### Create APP SRE Group

```sh
oc apply -f cluster-setup/03-quay-app-sre-group.yaml
```

### Create Cluster Role Binding

This will bind `cluster-admin` role to all users in APP SRE group.

```sh
oc apply -f cluster-setup/04-quay-app-sre-cluster-role-binding.yaml
```

## Configure Builder Project

### Create Builder Project

```sh
oc new-project builder
```

### Create Service Account

```sh
oc apply -n builder -f project-setup/01-service-account.yaml
```

### Create Ingress Network Policy

```sh
oc apply -n builder -f project-setup/02-ingress-network-policy.yaml
```

### Create Egress Network Policy

Note: Before applying egress network policy, make sure there no other egress network policy applied for the project. If OpenShift detects multiple egress network policy for a project, it will degrade the networking on purpose. Only one egress network policy is allowed in a project.

```sh
oc apply -n builder -f project-setup/03-egress-network-policy.yaml
```

### Create Security Context Constraints Role & Role Binding


```sh
oc apply -n builder -f project-setup/04-quay-builder-scc-role.yaml && oc apply -n builder -f project-setup/05-quay-builder-scc-rolebinding.yaml
```

### Create Image Pull Secret

```sh
oc apply -n builder -f project-setup/06-image-pull-secret.yaml
```

## Cluster Setup (contd.)

### SSL Certificate

Cluster is deployed with self-signed certificate. You will need to request SSL certificate from Digicert for the default ingress and the API server.

#### Create Certificate Signing Request

```sh
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
 -out star_apps_c1_ocp4-builder_quay_io.csr \
 -keyout star_apps_c1_ocp4-builder_quay_io.key \
 -subj "/C=US/ST=North Carolina/L=Raleigh/O=Red Hat, Inc./OU=Service Delivery - APP SRE/CN=*.apps.c1.ocp4-builder.quay.io"
```

Request a wildcard certificate from Digicert with 2 year validity. In your request, you should include all the subject alt names for the certificate. A cluster with base domain `subdomain.example.com` must have following subject alt names in the certificate request:

- `*.cluster-name.subdomain.example.com`
- `*.apps.cluster-name.subdomain.example.com`

Once your certificate request has been approved, you will receive email with the actual SSL certificates. SSL Certificates are stored in [Vault](https://vault.devshift.net/ui/vault/secrets/quay/show/quay-builder/ssl).

The certificate zip file will contain multiple `.crt` files. You need to combine all certificate files to create a `fullchain.crt` file. Order of certificate in `fullchain.crt` should be following:

1. star_your_domain.crt
2. DigiCertCA.crt
3. TrustedRoot.crt

#### Replacing the Default Ingress Certificate

##### Delete Existing Secret

Note: This secret will not exist on a fresh cluster.

```sh
oc delete secret certificate -n openshift-ingress
```

##### Create New Secret

```sh
oc create secret tls certificate --cert=fullchain.crt --key=star_c1_ocp4-builder_quay_io.key -n openshift-ingress
```

##### Update the Ingress Controller Configuration

```sh
oc patch ingresscontroller.operator default --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"defaultCertificate": {"name": "certificate"}}}' -n openshift-ingress-operator
```

#### Add an API Server Named Certificate

##### Delete Existing Secret

Note: This secret will not exist on a fresh cluster.

```sh
oc delete secret certificate -n openshift-config
```

##### Create New Secret

```sh
oc create secret tls certificate --cert=fullchain.crt --key=star_c1_ocp4-builder_quay_io.key -n openshift-config
```

##### Update the API Server Configuration

Note: Replace the domain name for API server with the one for your cluster.

```sh
oc patch apiserver cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"servingCerts": {"namedCertificates":  [{"names": ["api.c1.ocp4-builder.quay.io"], "servingCertificate": {"name": "certificate"}}]}}}'
```

### Create Machineset for Bare-Metal Worker Node

Note: Because `m5.metal` instances are expensive, add the node once you have completed rest of the setup steps.

To add `m5.metal` worker node, you will need to create a new [MachineSet](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.1/machine_management/creating-machineset.html). A copy of current MachineSet can be found [here](cluster-setup/05-bare-metal-machine-set.yaml).

```sh
oc apply -n openshift-machine-api -f cluster-setup/05-bare-metal-machine-set.yaml
```

#### Approve CSR for MachineSet

EC2 Instances of type metal.m5 are not automatically approved by the node auto-approver in OpenShift v4.1. We have filed a [bugzilla](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1723955) for engineering team. Current work around is to monitor pending CSR requests and approve them.

List all pending CSRs:

```sh
oc get csr
```

Approve all pending CSRs:

```sh
oc get csr | tail -n +2 | awk '{print $1}' | while read line; do oc adm certificate approve $line; done
```
