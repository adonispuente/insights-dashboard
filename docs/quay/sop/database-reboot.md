## Make sure you ran the diagnostics SOP first

- Click on Actions -> Reboot

- Check 'Reboot with Failover'

- Let the database instance start again, monitor active connections

- Redeploy quay: `oc patch deployment quay-app -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"annotations":{"quay-app-deployment":"ANY_RANDOM_STRING_WILL_TRIGGER_DEPLOYMENT"}}}}}'`
