#  Quay push/pull monitor on catchpoint failure

The push/pull monitor [check on Catchpoint](https://portal.catchpoint.com/ui/Symphony/ControlCenter/Tests/Test/1995486/Properties) runs a javascript script that periodically pushes and pulls against quay.io to determine end-to-end push/pull functionality is working

# Debugging check failures

1. Try a manual push or pull from your system. Check [quay smoke test file](quay-smoke-test.md) on how to run manual push/pulls
2. If pushes and pulls work for you consistently and on different images, there might be something wrong with the check. (TODO: determine action here)
3. If you see continuous or intermittent failures then it might be something wrong with Quay. 
4. Check the [error logs](../quayio.md#application-logs) to see if there are any `500` error messages. Please file a bug with `PROJQUAY` with the error information
5. If the failure is continuous and also acommponied by other alerts, it is a serious issue and would require a region failover. Please page the Quay oncall and start preparing for a region failover.
