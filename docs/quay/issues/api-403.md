# Debugging 403s

### Debugging the cause of the 403

- If possible, get the customer onto a real-time chat service (IRC).
- Ask the customer for the steps to reproduce the problem.
  - Which API call returns the 403?
  - Is the API call done manually or by a service?
  - Which user account / repository are used?
  - If the error occurs using Docker, which version of Docker is being used? v0.8.1, see below.
- Double check every parameter. **A misspelled repository leads to a 403 error and not a 404 one.**
  - Returning a 404 Not Found would leak information about the nonexistence of the requested repository to someone who may not be not allowed to access it. Instead of this, a 403 Forbidden is returned, so no information is leaked.
- In the case the error occurs using Docker and the customer is using a `$HOME/.dockercfg`, ask them to verify it. The file must accessible to the environment which is performing the push or pull.
  - If the customer is using MacOS, sometimes an error can occur due to Docker not being able to access the Key Store. This can be verified by having the customer try the same credentials via podman, or on another machine.

### The user is using docker v0.8.1
Tell them to upgrade.
