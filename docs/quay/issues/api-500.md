# Debugging 500s raised in the API

### Customer reporting of 500s

A 500 error occurring in the frontend/API layer will usually result in the customer landing on the
500 error page: [https://quay.io/500](https://quay.io/500).

### Debugging the cause of the 500

- If possible, get the customer onto a real-time chat service (IRC).
- Ask the customer for the steps to reproduce the problem.
- If the customer cannot reproduce the problem (or does not answer), check [Sentry](https://app.getsentry.com) or [Logs](../quayio.md#application-logs) for a likely error candidate.
- Once the problem has been identified and reproducable, file a new issue in the [Project Quay JIRA](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/PROJQUAY/issues) with the steps to reproduce, the exception raised (with full stack trace) and the e-mail address of the customer that reported the problem.
