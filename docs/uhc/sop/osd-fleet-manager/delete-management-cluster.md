# 1 Introduction
 
This document defines the steps to follow in order to delete a management cluster
 
## 1.1 Reference Articles
 
N/A
 
## 1.2 Use Cases
 
When a management cluster is no longer needed, this procedure should be followed.

## 1.3 Success Indicators
 
The management cluster is no longer listed
 
## 1.4 Stakeholders
 
Internal users
 
## 1.5 Additional Details
 
Deleting a management cluster via the OSDFM API simply moves it to `Deprovisioning` status. Asynchronous reconcilers will initiate the deletion of the management cluster fully, including quickly moving the management cluster to “maintenance” mode in the ACM placement decision so no new hostedClusters are added to it during the deprovisioning process.
 
# 2 Procedure
 
## 2.1 Plan
 
Make sure you have the permissions
* to delete (DELETE) and list (GET) Management Clusters

## 2.4 Validate
 
The Management Cluster status shall be `Deprovisionning` or `Cleanup*` or shall a return a 404:
