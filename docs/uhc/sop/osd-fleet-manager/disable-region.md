## 1.2 Use Cases

## 1.3 Success Indicators
 
At the end of the procedure, not clusters shall be listed in Fleet Manager for the disabled region

# 2 Procedure
 
## 2.1 Plan
 
Make sure you have access and have mergre permission to [app-interface](https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface)
 
## 2.2 Prerequisites
 
N/A
 
## 2.3 Execute
 
The regions that are enabled are defined in the app-interface SAAS file for OSD Fleet Manager, separately for each environment in int/stg/prod: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/blob/master/data/services/ocm/osd-fleet-manager/cicd/deploy.yaml

An MR is required to app-interface to remove the entry from the enabled_regions list in that file. Once the file is merged, the change will be propagated to the pods via normal deployment flows.

Verify that the region has been disabled with: `$ rosa list regions`

Once disabled, the management and service clusters will not be automatically deleted. They must each be deleted manually via the API:

List existing clusters in the region
```
$ ocm get /api/osd_fleet_mgmt/v1/service_clusters?search="region like '$REGION"
$ ocm get /api/osd_fleet_mgmt/v1/management_clusters?search="region like '$REGION"
``` 
And then
```
$ ocm delete /api/osd_fleet_mgmt/v1/management_clusters/${ID}
$ ocm delete /api/osd_fleet_mgmt/v1/service_clusters/${ID}
```
 
## 2.4 Validate
 
```
$ ocm get /api/osd_fleet_mgmt/v1/service_clusters?search="region like '$REGION"
$ ocm get /api/osd_fleet_mgmt/v1/management_clusters?search="region like '$REGION"
``` 
Should return empty items.
