# As a service owner, I should be able to see all users who have access to my service

Start by accessing the Visual App-Interface at https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net.  Using the side bar, navigate to the [Services](https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net/services) section.

Choose the relevant service from the list. For example, [telemeter](https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net/services#/services/telemeter/app.yml).

Choosing the service will take you to the the service's page, in which you can view a list of `Namespaces` which are related to this service.  In this example the namespaces are:
- `telemeter-production`
- `telemeter-stage`

Choose the namespace for which you would like to see the users. For this example, choose [telemeter-production](https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net/namespaces#/services/telemeter/namespaces/telemeter-production.yml).

Choosing the namespace will take you to the namespace's page, in which you can view a list of `Roles` which are associated with this namespace.  Some of the roles in this namespace are:
- `dev`
- `view`

Choosing a role will take you to the Role's page, in which you can view a list of `Users` who have this role associated to them, and the permissions granted through this role.  To finalize this example, choose the [dev](https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net/roles#/teams/telemeter/roles/dev.yml) role to see a list of users who has this role.

The users in this page are granted a `view` permission in the `telemeter-production` namespace through the `dev` role.  The relevant permission is `telemeter-production-view` (has the description `view permission on telemeter-production`).

To take it one step further, choose the [telemeter-production-view](https://visual-app-interface.devshift.net/permissions#/openshift/app-sre/permissions/telemeter-production-view.yml) permission to find which `Roles` are granting this permission.
