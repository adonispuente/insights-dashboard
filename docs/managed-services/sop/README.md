### Steps
- Check the Dependencies: OCM Cluster Service panel in the Kas Fleet Manager Metrics dasboard - https://grafana.app-sre.devshift.net/d/z1CmsruDn/kas-fleet-manager-metrics?orgId=1&var-datasource=app-sre-prod-04-prometheus&var-consoleurl=https:%2F%2Fconsole-openshift-console.apps.app-sre-prod-04.i5h0.p1.openshiftapps.com
- Check GlitchTip to investigate possible causes of the crash.
  - Stage: https://glitchtip.devshift.net/managed-services/issues?project=23
  - Production: https://glitchtip.devshift.net/managed-services/issues?project=27
- Check if the Kafka Service Fleet Manager pods are running and verify the logs.
    ```
    #example
    oc get pods -n <kas-fleet-manager-stage|kas-fleet-manager-production>

    kas-fleet-manager-58f7b8b649-2mgcp   1/1     Running
    kas-fleet-manager-58f7b8b649-blf5h   1/1     Running
    kas-fleet-manager-58f7b8b649-lzxms   1/1     Running

    # Check the pod logs to investigate possible causes (e.g. look for any Error/Exception messages)

    oc logs kas-fleet-manager-58f7b8b649-2mgcp  | less
    ```
    check the log to ensure the OSD Cluster worker is started, and there is exactly one OSD cluster leader running:
    ```
    oc logs <pod-name> | grep 'Running as the leader.*ClusterManager' 
     
    You should see output similar to the below from any one of the pods: 
    "Running as the leader and starting worker *workers.ClusterManager"
    ``` 
- Check database to investigate if the OSD is created, and there is record in the table:
   ```
   #Look up secret/kas-fleet-manager-rds, login to database.
   psql
   #connect to services API DB
   \c kas-fleet-manager
   ```
   ```
   #Investigate the data in the following table:
   #Table: OSD Clusters
   #Check if there is at least one OSD cluster created and in `ready` status.
   select status,  to_char(now() - updated_at,'HH24:MI') idle_time, count(1) from clusters group by status, to_char(now() - updated_at,'HH24:MI');
   
   #In case there are records with `cluster_accepted`, `cluster_provisioning`, or `cluster_provisioned` status, and the idle_time is over 45 mins, check the log for any abnormality.
   #In case there is record with `failed` status, check the log for the error message.
   ```
- How to handle
    - Error/exception appears related to Manager Services API or no leader worker is running, try to restart the pods.
    - If the cluster request in DB is `cluster_accepted` status, and their idle_time is over 3 mins, try to restart the pods.
    - Error/exception related to OCM, or cluster requests in DB that are not `ready` and not in `cluster_accepted` status, and their idle_time is over 45 mins, check with OCM support to see if they've received OSD cluster request.
    - Otherwise, or if unsure about the reason, escalate the issue to the Control Plane team

## Kafka Cluster provisioning correctness

### Impact

Kafka Service Fleet Manager service is experiencing issue while provisioning Kafka clusters.

### Summary

Kafka Service Fleet Manager is not able to provision Kafka cluster correctly.

### Access required

- OSD Console access to the cluster that runs the Kafka Service Fleet Manager .
- Access to cluster resources: Pods/Deployments

### Relevant secrets

kas-fleet-manager-rds

### Steps

NOTE: This SLO is currently not active. More details here: https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/service/app-interface/-/merge_requests/19100 and https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGDSTRM-2940.
The alerts are firing because The Kafka instance can go into a failed state during creation but will eventually provision successfully. Our Kafka correctness (create) SLO only makes sense if a Kafka instance stays in a failed state.

Based on the conversation with the Instance Team, it was the intention that a "Failed" state from the fleetshard would be terminal. There are a couple of Strimzi defects currently that cause the fleetshard to report failed during creation when it shouldn't.

https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/4855
https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/4856
https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/4869
https://github.com/strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator/issues/4872

Until these issues are resolved which will likely take weeks or 1-2 months, we need to turn this alert off in stage and prod. We do so by silencing this alert here:
https://alertmanager.app-sre-prod-04.devshift.net/#/silences/

```
alertname=~KasFleetManagerKafkaCreationSuccess.*
cluster=app-sre-prod-04
environment=production
namespace=managed-services-production
operation=create
prometheus=openshift-customer-monitoring/app-sre
service=kas-fleet-manager
severity=info
infoalertname=~KasFleetManagerKafkaCreationSuccess.*
```

Once these issues have been fixed, this note can be removed, the silenced alert removed, and the steps mentioned below unstriked.

## Kafka Cluster deletion correctness

### Impact

Kafka Service Fleet Manager service is experiencing issue while deleting Kafka clusters.

### Summary

Kafka Service Fleet Manager is not able to performing Kafka cluster deletion correctly.

### Access required

- OSD Console access to the cluster that runs the Kafka Service Fleet Manager .
- Access to cluster resources: Pods/Deployments

### Relevant secrets

kas-fleet-manager-rds

### Steps

refer to the steps [Kafka cluster provisioning latency](#kafka-cluster-provisioning-latency)

## Kas Fleet Manager Version Mismatch

### Impact

Kafka cluster has mismatched version(s) for more than 15 minutes

### Summary

Kafka cluster has a mismatch (actual vs desired) of one or more versions (ibp version, strimzi version, kafka version). This can potentially be happening due to unsuccessful kafka upgrade.

### Access required

- OSD Console access to the cluster that runs the Kas Service Fleet Manager.
- Access to cluster resources: Pods/Deployments

### Relevant secrets

kas-fleet-manager-rds

### Steps

Check the status of relevant kafka (by its id returned in the alert) and see if its failed. Check if there is a reason for failure. Find the relevant kafka in [this dashboard](https://grafana.app-sre.devshift.net/d/viefn9LMz/mk-fleet-links?orgId=1&refresh=1m) to see more information about not matching kafka versions.
If unsure about the reason or how to resolve the issue, refer to [Escalations](#escalations) section below.

## Kas Fleet Manager Kafkas Stuck In Suspending State

### Impact

Kafka cluster stuck in suspending state for more than 5 minutes

### Summary

Kafka cluster is stuck in suspending state for more than 5 minutes. The transition from suspending to suspended status should normally be a fast process and if it exceeds 5 minutes, it indicates that there is an issue that requires investigation

### Access required

- OSD Console access to the cluster that runs the Kas Service Fleet Manager.
- Access to cluster resources: Pods/Deployments

### Relevant secrets

### Steps

Check the relevant kafka(s) (by the id(s) returned in the alert) on the dataplane cluster. Check if there are any errors in the kas-fleetshard operator logs.
If unsure about the reason or how to resolve the issue, refer to [Escalations](#escalations) section below.

---

## Kas Fleet Manager Kafkas Stuck In Resuming State

### Impact

Kafka cluster stuck in resuming state for more than 15 minutes

### Summary

Kafka cluster is stuck in resuming state for more than 15 minutes. The transition from resuming to ready status should normally be similar to kafka request creation time. If it takes much longer, it might indicate that there is an issue that requires investigation.

### Access required

- OSD Console access to the cluster that runs the Kas Service Fleet Manager.
- Access to cluster resources: Pods/Deployments

### Relevant secrets

### Steps

Check the relevant kafka(s) (by the id(s) returned in the alert) on the dataplane cluster. Check if there are any errors in the kas-fleetshard operator logs, running pods or if any pods are crashlooping.
If unsure about the reason or how to resolve the issue, refer to [Escalations](#escalations) section below.

---

## Escalations

- Error/exception appears related to Manager Services API or no leader worker is running, try to restart the pods.
- Error/exception related to OCM, check with OCM support to see if they've received OSD cluster request.
- Error/exception events found in the OSD cluster level, check with OCM support.
- Error/exception related to Kafka or strimzi-operator, check with Data Plane or MK SRE support.
- Otherwise, or if unsure about the reason, escalate the issue to the Control Plane team
